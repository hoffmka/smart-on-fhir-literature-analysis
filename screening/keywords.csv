It goes on to discuss health informatics from an historical perspective, its current state and its likely future state now that electronic health record systems are widely deployed, the HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability standard is being rapidly accepted as the means to access the data stored in those systems and analytics is increasing being used to gain new knowledge from that aggregated clinical data. It then turns to some of the important and evolving areas of informatics including population and public health, mHealth and big data and analytics. Use cases and case studies are used in all of these discussions to help readers connect the technologies to real world challenges.Effective use of informatics systems and tools by providers and their patients is key to improving the quality, safety and cost of healthcare. With health records now digital, no effective means has existed for sharing them with patients, among the multiple providers who may care for them and for important secondary uses such as public/population health and research. This problem is a topic of congressional discussion and is addressed by the 21st Century Cures Act of 2016 that mandates that electronic health record (EHR) systems offer a patient-facing API.HL7’s Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is that API and this is the first comprehensive treatment of the technology and the many ways it is already being used. FHIR is based on web technologies and is thus a far more facile, easy to implement approach that is rapidly gaining acceptance. It is also the basis for a ‘universal health app platform’ that literally has the potential to foster innovation around the data in patient records similar to the app ecosystems smartphones created around the data they store. FHIR app stores have already been opened by Epic and Cerner, the two largest enterprise EHR vendors.Provider facing apps are already being explored to improve EHR usability and support personalized medicine. Medicare and the Veteran’s Administration have announced FHIR app platforms for their patients. Apple’s new IOS 11.3 features the ability for consumers to aggregate their health records on their iPhone using FHIR. Health insurance companies are exploring applications of FHIR to improve service and communication with their providers and patients. SureScripts, the national e-Prescribing network, is using FHIR to help doctors know if their patients are complying with prescriptions.This textbook is for introductory health informatics courses for computer science and health sciences students (e.g. doctors, nurses, PhDs), the current health informatics community, IT professionals interested in learning about the field and practicing healthcare providers. Though this textbook covers an important new technology, it is accessible to non-technical readers including healthcare providers, their patients or anyone interested in the use of healthcare data for improved care, public/population health or research. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

It provides continuous, person-centered, relationship-based care that considers the needs and preferences of individuals, families, and communities. Without access to high-quality primary care, minor health problems can spiral into chronic disease, chronic disease management becomes difficult and uncoordinated, visits to emergency departments increase, preventive care lags, and health care spending soars to unsustainable levels. Unequal access to primary care remains a concern, and the COVID-19 pandemic amplified pervasive economic, mental health, and social health disparities that ubiquitous, high-quality primary care might have reduced. Primary care is the only health care component where an increased supply is associated with better population health and more equitable outcomes. For this reason, primary care is a common good, which makes the strength and quality of the country’s primary care services a public concern. Implementing High-Quality Primary Care: Rebuilding the Foundation of Health Care puts forth an evidence-based plan with actionable objectives and recommendations for implementing high-quality primary care in the United States.

In different domains of healthcare AI is being used extensively due to its capability to overpower human potential in analyzing the complex forms of data with better accuracy. This article explores the domains where AI has found its applications in the healthcare sector. Healthcare data includes biomedical and clinical data includes images, microbiomic, electronic health records (EHRs), and genetics data form to perform the analysis on it. Machine learning (ML) algorithms that are used for performing the predictions on the dataset are classified as classical ML and Deep learning is based on the capability of the algorithms to process the data to perform the predictions. Various applications have been discussed in the article where the ML algorithms play an important role due to their capability of transfer learning, especially for the diagnostics field. The emergence of the huge amount of biomedical data has made AI an inseparable part of the data analysis due to its strong prediction capability. The accurate translation of AI research into clinically relevant results is a bit challenging due to various reasons like performing retrospective study instead of the prospective one in the clinical field, AI metrics accuracy does not often reflect the clinical efficacy and applicability. © 2021 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

These diabetes technologies generate a wealth of data that until fairly recently was only accessible through manufacturer or developer data portals, decreasing their usability and portability into healthcare settings. Electronic health record data integration presents an exciting opportunity to simplify and streamline diabetes care into a single workflow. By incorporating these additional data sources into the patient's record, providers will have a more holistic view of the patient, which will enable more personalized treatment plans and more comprehensive documentation. However, there are several technical, operational, financial, and regulatory considerations for any data integration project. A relatively recent development, there are few standards for diabetes technology data, resulting in a variety of approaches that may inhibit diffusion and interoperability. This chapter will (1) explore a framework to understand the components required for successful diabetes technology data integration, (2) identify critical barriers to making progress in the field, and (3) propose solutions to deliver on the promise of digital diabetes care. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

One of the major bottlenecks of such silo systems is that they do not fully adhere to healthcare standards. This leads to inefficient utilization of such existing applications. The solution to such a problem is to design a new healthcare system that follows the existing standards. However, migrating the existing data to a newly designed system may not be easy due to its scale and nature. Alternatively, it may be possible to interconnect healthcare systems by bridging the existing data and data standards gap. With interoperability between the healthcare systems, a novel common data interface (CDI) layer is proposed.

In that later role, advanced by investments to counter the recent epidemic of opioid overdoses and the COVID-19 pandemic, public health decision support systems are beginning to have major impacts on the healthcare system. Public health decision support systems have many technically advanced features and use data integration, platform-independent implementations of decision-making logic, and advanced approaches for triggering of reporting of cases, based on national standards, to create tools to influence the health system. There is strong data to show the impacts of decision support systems on opioid prescribing and on uptake of vaccines (at a population level) and preliminary data on their value in decision making on vaccine administration at an individual level and for increased reporting of public health notifiable conditions. With deeper integration with electronic health record systems, based on the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource standards, and appropriate governmental policy backing, the ability for public health to influence the healthcare system through decision support techniques seems likely to increase over the next few years. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

One method that has been investigated and shows promise to being widely disseminated is called “infobuttons.” We describe work to develop infobutton managers that provide a flexible, generic method for integrating infobuttons with clinical systems. These infobutton managers have been successfully integrated with several different clinical information systems in an institution-independent manner.

By contrast, patient-directed decision support (support directed toward patients) has attracted less attention in the field. Patient-directed decision support involves supporting patients and their caregivers, with or without their care teams, in health-related decisions and actions. Information alone is not sufficient to support patient decisions: information about a decision must be accompanied by methods of eliciting patient values and preferences, guidance about how to apply values and preferences to decisions, and support for patient-provider shared decision making discussions. Technological solutions for patients include decision aids for one-time decisions and disease management systems for recurring disease-related decisions. All solutions for patients must consider technology access and literacy, self-efficacy for decision making, health literacy and numeracy, and implementation into workflow. Bringing informatics awareness to this important work could strengthen the field by ensuring that the tools patients need for decisions are grounded in the best evidence, developed with attention to patient needs and requirements, and (where appropriate) integrated into clinical systems, teams, and workflow. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

This requiresmobile and desktop applications for patients and medical providers to obtain healthcare data from multiple HITs, which may be operating with different paradigms (e.g., cloud services, programming services, web services), use different cloud service providers, and employ different security/access control techniques. To address these issues, this chapter introduces and discusses an Access Control Framework for Secure and Interoperable Cloud Computing (FSICC) that provides a mechanism for multiple HITs to register cloud, programming, and web services and security requirements for use by applications. FSICC supports a global security policy and enforcement mechanism for cloud services with role-based (RBAC), discretionary (DAC), and mandatory (MAC) access controls. The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard models healthcare data using a set of 93 resources to track a patient's clinical findings, problems, etc. For each resource, an FHIR Application Program Interface (API) is defined to share data in a common format for each HIT that can be accessed by mobile applications. Thus, there is a need to support with a heterogeneous set of information sources and differing security protocols (i.e., RBAC, DAC, and MAC). To demonstrate the realization of FSICC, we apply the framework to the integration of the Connecticut Concussion Tracker (CT2) mHealth application with the OpenEMR electronic medical record utilizing FHIR. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",,,Springer Singapore,,,,Book chapter,Final,

Real-time predictions provided by such models can aid physicians in interpreting the vast amount of patient data generated in the ICU. A huge percentage of electronic health record (EHR) data is generated through ICUs. Data for this study were extracted from MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care), a time-series database of intensive care unit (ICU) patient data. Applications of deep learning and nature-inspired algorithms for health care have evolved over the last few years. In this research, different deep-learning algorithms, such as long short-term memory (LSTM) and long short-term memory-attention (LSTM-AT), are investigated, using discharge notes and clinical and laboratory recordings, for hospital readmission and mortality prediction tasks. We have used explicit approaches for both the applications. An AUC (area under curve) of 0.72 for the hospital readmission task utilizing the discharge notes and an AUC of 0.87 for mortality prediction utilizing the bedside recordings were achieved. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Communication protocols are in the server layer, which helps in authorizing the data between devices and IoT in many fields. The need for the protocols is very important such as CoAP and MQTT, which is more compatible. The information that is transferred to the doctor will be sent to sensing layer which will be processed and stored.

Sensor-based devices connected with the patient can capture body vitals like heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels, thus providing broader scope for remote patient monitoring of chronic or long-term conditions, tracking patient medication orders, and even tracking the mobility pattern and location of patients. Further, healthcare-related wearable devices can be configured to send emergency information to caregivers. When these IoMT-based devices are connected and configured with the patient healthcare monitoring system or hospital system, they are expected to provide effective assistance towards the decision-making process required for the treatment. This book chapter intends to discuss the basic concepts associated with IoMT and review the current state of the Internet of Things applied to healthcare and medical technologies and focus on an application based on IoMT. Recently, this field has seen exponential growth in terms of products and research at different levels, such as sensors, networks, and repositories. This chapter further focuses on application based on location tracking of movable healthcare base sensor devices, data acquisition from those devices, and efficient processing for decision-making. Lastly, the authors are also interested to include a case study based on the mentioned application. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Big data technologies; Data sciences; Embedded systems; Heterogeneity; Internet of medical things; Interoperability,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,,Book chapter,Final,

Advances in smartphone software and hardware coupled with rising availability of wearable devices have resulted in exponential growth in the health apps market. Recent estimates suggest that more than 259,000 mHealth apps are available on app stores today and account for approximately 3.2 billion downloads annually. The evidence base supporting the use of apps independently of other interventions remains quite thin, and this has led to skepticism among large medical organizations about the role apps may play in healthcare. Nevertheless, apps continue to displace older technologies in several domains, for example, by replacing dedicated communication devices for individuals with autism and replacing medical bands with medical identification built into smartphone lock screens. Barriers such as privacy concerns and lack of integration into the electronic health record have limited the impact of apps, but mHealth has enormous potential to reshape healthcare delivery in the future. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The new requirements of the so-called eHealth Act mean that payment-driven and legal liability documentation will become increasingly medically dominated documentation. Additionally, patient data are no longer collected exclusively by physicians, but rather accumulated from many different sources. Patients are placed in the position of being able to document their data in their own patient records. Materials and methods: The requirements of medical documentation according to the German Code of Social Law (Sozialgesetzbuch, SGB) V were analyzed. The services of the systems for practice-based gynecologists and for gynecological departments in hospitals were summarized. Furthermore, a literature search was performed in PubMed and within the relevant journals for gynecology. Results: Since different organizations set different requirements for the content and technical aspects of medical and administrative applications and concepts, the documentation for the requirements is not only extensive, but also highly complicated and time consuming. Semantic interoperability is not given. Conclusion: The unclarified IT (information technology) situation in the German health care sector with respect to the IT standards to be applied faces all players with formidable challenges. Patients and medical staff are the persons affected. An all-encompassing e‑health strategy supported by all players including harmonization of the ensuing documentation is currently lacking. © 2018, Springer Verlag.

With increasing implementation of electronic health records (EHRs) and laboratory information systems worldwide, there is increasing demand for well-designed and evidence-based electronic resources. Both complex data-driven and simple interpretative electronic healthcare tools are currently available to improve the integration of clinical and laboratory information towards a more patient-centered approach to medicine. Several studies have reported positive clinical impact of electronic healthcare tool implementation in clinical laboratory diagnostics, including in the management of neonatal bilirubinemia, cardiac disease, and nutritional status. As patients have increasing access to their medical laboratory data, it is essential that accessible electronic healthcare tools are evidence-based and user-friendly for individuals of varying digital and medical literacy. Indeed, studies suggest electronic healthcare tool development processes significantly lack the involvement of relevant healthcare professionals and often present misinformation, including erroneous calculation algorithms or inappropriate interpretative recommendations. The current review provides an overview of the utility of available electronic healthcare tools in clinical laboratory diagnostics and critically reviews potential limitations and benefits of their clinical implementation.

Summary: Women are underrepresented in clinical trials and less likely to undergo DBS compared to their male counterparts. Racial and ethnic minorities are also less likely to undergo DBS procedures, even when controlling for disease severity and other demographic factors. These disparities can have significant impacts on patients' access to care, quality of life, and ability to manage their debilitating movement disorders. Key Messages: Addressing these disparities requires increasing patient awareness and education, minimizing barriers to equitable access, and implementing diversity and inclusion initiatives within the healthcare system. In this systematic review, we first review literature discussing gender, racial, and socioeconomic disparities in DBS access and then propose several patient, provider, community, and national-level interventions to improve DBS access for all populations. © 2024 The Author(s).

These platforms are still in constant development and, so far, most of the data they store is entered manually by users. However, more and better wearable devices are being developed that can synchronize with these platforms to feed the information automatically. Another aspect that highlights the link between wearable devices and cloud-based health platforms is the improvement in which the symptomatology and/or physical status information of users can be stored and syn-chronized in real-time, 24 h a day, in health platforms, which in turn enables the possibility of synchronizing these platforms with specialized medical software to promptly detect important variations in user symptoms. This is opening opportunities to use these platforms as support for monitoring disease symptoms and, in general, for monitoring the health of users.

This scoping review systematically maps challenges and facilitators to longitudinal CDS that are applied at two or more timepoints for the same decision made by the same patient or clinician. Methods: We searched Embase, PubMed, and Medline databases for articles describing development, validation, or implementation of patient- or clinician-facing longitudinal CDS. Validated quality assessment tools were used for article selection. Challenges and facilitators to longitudinal CDS are reported according to PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Results: Eight articles met inclusion criteria; each article described a unique CDS. None used entirely automated data entry, none used living guidelines for updating the evidence base or knowledge engine as new evidence emerged during the longitudinal study, and one included formal readiness for change assessments. Seven of eight CDS were implemented and evaluated prospectively. Challenges were primarily related to suboptimal study design (with unique challenges for each study) or user interface. Facilitators included use of randomized trial designs for prospective enrollment, increased CDS uptake during longitudinal exposure, and machine-learning applications that are tailored to the CDS use case. Conclusions: Despite the intuitive advantages of representing healthcare decisions longitudinally, peer-reviewed literature on longitudinal CDS is sparse. Existing reports suggest opportunities to incorporate longitudinal CDS frameworks, automated data entry, living guidelines, and user readiness assessments. Generating best practice guidelines for longitudinal CDS would require a greater depth and breadth of published work and expert opinion. © The Author(s) 2024.",CDS; CDSS; evolve; healthcare; Shared decision-making,,SAGE Publications Inc.,,,,Review,Final,

Standardized data and well-defined relationships between data points are necessary to guarantee semantic interoperability. Using the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard for clinical data representation would be a practical methodology to enhance and accelerate interoperability and data availability for research. Objective: This research aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art and current landscape in FHIR-based data models and structures. In addition, we intend to identify and discuss the tools, resources, limitations, and other critical aspects mentioned in the selected research papers. Methods: To ensure the extraction of reliable results, we followed the instructions of the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist. We analyzed the indexed articles in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, the ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar. After identifying, extracting, and assessing the quality and relevance of the articles, we synthesized the extracted data to identify common patterns, themes, and variations in the use of FHIR-based data models and structures across different studies. Results: On the basis of the reviewed articles, we could identify 2 main themes: dynamic (pipeline-based) and static data models. The articles were also categorized into health care use cases, including chronic diseases, COVID-19 and infectious diseases, cancer research, acute or intensive care, random and general medical notes, and other conditions. Furthermore, we summarized the important or common tools and approaches of the selected papers. These items included FHIR-based tools and frameworks, machine learning approaches, and data storage and security. The most common resource was “Observation” followed by “Condition” and “Patient.” The limitations and challenges of developing data models were categorized based on the issues of data integration, interoperability, standardization, performance, and scalability or generalizability. Conclusions: FHIR serves as a highly promising interoperability standard for developing real-world health care apps. The implementation of FHIR modeling for electronic health record data facilitates the integration, transmission, and analysis of data while also advancing translational research and phenotyping. Generally, FHIR-based exports of local data repositories improve data interoperability for systems and data warehouses across different settings. However, ongoing efforts to address existing limitations and challenges are essential for the successful implementation and integration of FHIR data models. ©Parinaz Tabari, Gennaro Costagliola, Mattia De Rosa, Martin Boeker.",data model; Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources; FHIR; interoperability; modeling; PRISMA,,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

Despite the increasing integration of information systems (ISs), research on their efficacy is conflicting. Drawing on related fields, we investigate how timing and mode of delivery influence IS effectiveness. Our objective is to reconcile previous contradictory findings, shedding light on optimal IS design in the ED. Materials and methods: We conducted a systematic review following PRISMA across PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. We coded the ISs’ timing as heuristic or analytical, their mode of delivery as active for automatic alerts and passive when requiring user-initiated information retrieval, and their effect on process, economic, and clinical outcomes. Results: Our analysis included 83 studies. During early heuristic decision-making, most active interventions were ineffective, while passive interventions generally improved outcomes. In the analytical phase, the effects were reversed. Passive interventions that facilitate information extraction consistently improved outcomes. Discussion: Our findings suggest that the effectiveness of active interventions negatively correlates with the amount of information received during delivery. During early heuristic decision-making, when information overload is high, physicians are unresponsive to alerts and proactively consult passive resources. In the later analytical phases, physicians show increased receptivity to alerts due to decreased diagnostic uncertainty and information quantity. Interventions that limit information lead to positive outcomes, supporting our interpretation. Conclusion: We synthesize our findings into an integrated model that reveals the underlying reasons for conflicting findings from previous reviews and can guide practitioners in designing ISs in the ED. © The Author(s) 2024.

Material and Methods: At first, a broad electronic search of all available literature in English was conducted on the topic through a search in the databases of Medline, Web of Science, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Scopus, and Cochrane. Then, stakeholders’ requirements were tabulated, and finally, a word cloud was generated and analyzed to achieve functional and non-functional cases. Results: A total of 81 articles were included in the given analysis. Integration requirements also consisted of nine functional cases including a uniform approach to the interpretation of genetic tests, standardized terminologies and ontologies, structured data entry as much as possible, an integrated online patient portal, multiple data source handling, machine-readable storing and reporting, research-oriented requirements, pharmacogenomics decision support capabilities, and phenotyping algorithms and knowledge base. Besides, there were three non-functional cases comprised of interoperability of multiple systems, ethical, legal, security factor, and big data computations.

Despite recent uptake in AI research and adoption, the extent to which it improves quality, efficiency and equity of care beyond cancer diagnostics is uncertain to date. Henceforth, the objective of our systematic review is to assess the clinical readiness and deployability of AI through evaluation of prospective studies of AI in cancer care following diagnosis. We undertook a systematic review to determine the types of AI involved and their respective outcomes. A PubMed and Web of Science search between 1 January 2013 and 1 May 2023 identified 15 articles detailing prospective evaluation of AI in postdiagnostic cancer pathway. We appraised all studies using Risk of Bias Assessment of Randomised Controlled Trials and Risk of Bias In Non-randomised Studies-of Interventions quality assessment tools, as well as implementational analysis concerning time, cost and resource, to ascertain the quality of clinical evidence and real-world feasibility of AI. The results revealed that the majority of AI oncological research remained experimental without prospective clinical validation or deployment. Most studies failed to establish clinical validity and to translate measured AI efficacy into beneficial clinical outcomes. AI research are limited by lack of research standardisation and health system interoperability. Furthermore, implementational analysis and equity considerations of AI were largely missing. To overcome the triad of low-level clinical evidence, efficacy-outcome gap and incompatible research ecosystem for AI, future work should focus on multicollaborative AI implementation research designed and conducted in accordance with up-to-date research standards and local health systems.  © 2024 The Author(s).",chemotherapy; palliative care; radiation oncology; surgical oncology,,BMJ Publishing Group,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

Digital healthcare ecosystems emerge to target increasing healthcare costs and invest in standard Application Programming Interfaces (API), such as HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (HL7 FHIR) for trusted data flows. Objectives: This scoping review assessed the role and impact of HL7 FHIR and associated Implementation Guides (IGs) in digital healthcare ecosystems focusing on chronic disease management. Methods: To study trends and developments relevant to HL7 FHIR, a scoping review of the scientific and gray English literature from 2017 to 2023 was used. Results: The selection of 93 of 524 scientific papers reviewed in English indicates that the popularity of HL7 FHIR as a robust technical interface standard for the health sector has been steadily rising since its inception in 2010, reaching a peak in 2021. Digital Health applications use HL7 FHIR in cancer (45 %), cardiovascular disease (CVD) (more than 15 %), and diabetes (almost 15 %). The scoping review revealed that references to HL7 FHIR IGs are limited to ∼ 20 % of articles reviewed. HL7 FHIR R4 was most frequently referenced when the HL7 FHIR version was mentioned. In HL7 FHIR IGs registries and the internet, we found 35 HL7 FHIR IGs addressing chronic disease management, i.e., cancer (40 %), chronic disease management (25 %), and diabetes (20 %). HL7 FHIR IGs frequently complement the information in the article.

Data, once directed by a patient to leave a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-covered health entity and enter a consumer app, will usually fall under Federal Trade Commission oversight. Because the statutory authority of the ONC does not extend to health data protection, there is not yet regulation to specifically address privacy protections for consumer apps. A technologically feasible workflow that could be widely adopted and permissible under ONC's rule, involves using the SMART on FHIR OAuth authorization routine to present standardized information about app behavior. This approach would not bias the patient in a way that triggers penalties under information blocking provisions of the rule.  © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) is an open global standard that facilitates structuring of health information for coordinated exchange among stakeholders. Objective: The objective of this study is to design FHIR profiles and present methodology and the profiled FHIR resource for Maternal and Child Health referral use cases in Ebonyi state, Nigeria-a typical low- and middle-income country (LMIC) setting. Methods: Practicing doctors, midwives, and nurses were purposefully sampled and surveyed. Different referral forms were reviewed. The union of data sets from surveys and forms was aggregated and mapped to base patient FHIR resource elements, and extensions were created for data sets not in the core FHIR specification. This study also introduced FHIR and its relation to the World Health Organization's (WHO's) International Classification of Diseases. Results: We found many different data elements from the referral forms and survey responses even in urban settings. The resulting FHIR standard profile is published on GitHub for adaptation or adoption as necessary to aid alignment with WHO recommendations. Understanding data sets used in health care and clinical practice for information sharing is crucial in properly standardizing information sharing, particularly during the management of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. Development organizations and governments can use this methodology and profile to fast-track FHIR standards adoption for paper and electronic information sharing at PHC systems in LMICs. Conclusions: We presented our methodology for profiling the referral resource crucial for the standardized exchange of new and expectant moms' information.

However, possible unintended consequences during use, which can occur owing to low usability or the lack of adaption to existing workflows (eg, high cognitive load), may pose a challenge. To prevent this, the involvement of users in the development of EHRs is crucial and growing. Overall, involvement is designed to be very multifaceted, for example, in terms of the timing, frequency, or even methods used to capture user preferences. Objective: Setting, users and their needs, and the context and practice of health care must be considered in the design and subsequent implementation of EHRs. Many different approaches to user involvement exist, each requiring a variety of methodological choices. The aim of the study was to provide an overview of the existing forms of user involvement and the circumstances they need and to provide support for the planning of new involvement processes. Methods: We conducted a scoping review to provide a database for future projects on which design of inclusion is worthwhile and to show the diversity of reporting. Using a very broad search string, we searched the PubMed, CINAHL, and Scopus databases. In addition, we searched Google Scholar. Hits were screened according to scoping review methodology and then examined, focusing on methods and materials, participants, frequency and design of the development, and competencies of the researchers involved. Results: In total, 70 articles were included in the final analysis. There was a wide range of methods of involvement. Physicians and nurses were the most frequently included groups and, in most cases, were involved only once in the process. The approach of involvement (eg, co-design) was not specified in most of the studies (44/70, 63%). Further qualitative deficiencies in the reporting were evident in the presentation of the competences of members of the research and development teams. Think-aloud sessions, interviews, and prototypes were frequently used. Conclusions: This review provides insights into the diversity of health care professionals' involvement in the development of EHRs. It provides an overview of the different approaches in various fields of health care. However, it also shows the necessity of considering quality standards in the development of EHRs together with future users and the need for reporting this in future studies. © Theresa Sophie Busse, Chantal Jux, Johannes Laser, Peter Rasche, Horst Christian Vollmar, Jan P Ehlers, Sven Kernebeck.",digital technology; electronic health records; electronic medical records; stakeholder participation; technology development; user-centered design,,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

Intuitive practices for thromboprophylaxis have resulted in many patients being inappropriately prophylaxed. We conducted a narrative review summarizing system-wide thromboprophylaxis interventions in hospitalized patients. Multiple interventions for thromboprophylaxis have been tested, including multifaceted approaches such as national VTE prevention programs with audits, pre-printed order entry, passive alerts (either human or electronic), and more recently, the use of active clinical decision support (CDS) tools incorporated into electronic health records (EHRs). Multifaceted health-system and order entry interventions have shown mixed results in their ability to increase appropriate thromboprophylaxis and reduce VTE unless mandated through a national VTE prevention program, though the latter approach is potentially costly and effort- and time-dependent. Studies utilizing passive human or electronic alerts have also shown mixed results in increasing appropriate thromboprophylaxis and reducing VTE. Recently, a universal cloud-based and EHR-agnostic CDS VTE tool incorporating a validated VTE risk score revealed high adoption and effectiveness in increasing appropriate thromboprophylaxis and reducing major thromboembolism. Active CDS tools hold promise in improving appropriate thromboprophylaxis, especially with further refinement and widespread implementation within various EHRs and clinical workflows. © 2024 by the authors.",clinical decision support tools; electronic health records; hospitalized patients; thromboprophylaxis; venous thromboembolism,anticoagulant agent; enoxaparin; heparin; low molecular weight heparin; artery thrombosis; bleeding; checklist; clinical audit; clinical decision support system; cloud computing; consensus; data base; deep vein thrombosis; electronic health record; estimated glomerular filtration rate; evidence based medicine; evidence based practice; high risk patient; hospital patient; human; international normalized ratio; lung embolism; meta analysis (topic); mortality; observational study; pharmacist; physician; practice guideline; protocol compliance; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; risk; risk assessment; risk reduction; scoring system; software; surgical patient; systematic review (topic); thrombosis prevention; total quality management; venous thromboembolism; workflow,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

Materials and Methods: We used PubMed as our focus is applications of SDI in biomedical domains and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) to search and report for relevant studies published between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2021. We used Covidence—a systematic review management system—to carry out this scoping review. Results: The initial search from PubMed resulted in 5,326 articles using the two sets of keywords. We then removed 44 duplicates and 5,282 articles were retained for abstract screening. After abstract screening, we included 246 articles for full-text screening, among which 87 articles were deemed eligible for full-text extraction. We summarized the 87 articles from four aspects: (1) methods for the global schema; (2) data integration strategies (i.e., federated system vs. data warehousing); (3) the sources of the data; and (4) downstream applications. Conclusion: SDI approach can effectively resolve the semantic heterogeneities across different data sources. We identified two key gaps and challenges in existing SDI studies that (1) many of the existing SDI studies used data from only single-level data sources (e.g., integrating individual-level patient records from different hospital systems), and (2) documentation of the data integration processes is sparse, threatening the reproducibility of SDI studies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Common data element; Common data model; Ontology; Semantic data integration; Systematic review and meta-analyses (PRISMA) framework,Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Mass Screening; Reproducibility of Results; Semantics; Abstracting; Data warehouses; Health; Hospitals; Semantics; Common data element; Common data model; Common datum; Data elements; Meta-analysis; Ontology's; Semantic data; Semantic data integration; Systematic Review; Systematic review and meta-analyze (preferred reporting item for systematic review and meta-analyze) framework; adult; common data elements; data integration; data warehouse; documentation; extraction; female; hospital planning; human; male; medical record; Medline; ontology; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; reproducibility; review; systematic review; information retrieval; mass screening; semantics; Data integration,Elsevier Ireland Ltd,,,,Review,Final,

85,Amar F.; April A.; Abran A.,Electronic Health Record and Semantic Issues Using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources: Systematic Mapping Review,2024,Journal of Medical Internet Research,3.0,10.2196/45209,"Background: The increasing use of electronic health records and the Internet of Things has led to interoperability issues at different levels (structural and semantic). Standards are important not only for successfully exchanging data but also for appropriately interpreting them (semantic interoperability). Thus, to facilitate the semantic interoperability of data exchanged in health care, considerable resources have been deployed to improve the quality of shared clinical data by structuring and mapping them to the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. Objective: The aims of this study are 2-fold: to inventory the studies on FHIR semantic interoperability resources and terminologies and to identify and classify the approaches and contributions proposed in these studies. Methods: A systematic mapping review (SMR) was conducted using 10 electronic databases as sources of information for inventory and review studies published during 2012 to 2022 on the development and improvement of semantic interoperability using the FHIR standard. Results: A total of 70 FHIR studies were selected and analyzed to identify FHIR resource types and terminologies from a semantic perspective. The proposed semantic approaches were classified into 6 categories, namely mapping (31/126, 24.6%), terminology services (18/126, 14.3%), resource description framework or web ontology language–based proposals (24/126, 19%), annotation proposals (18/126, 14.3%), machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) proposals (20/126, 15.9%), and ontology-based proposals (15/126, 11.9%). From 2012 to 2022, there has been continued research in 6 categories of approaches as well as in new and emerging annotations and ML and NLP proposals. This SMR also classifies the contributions of the selected studies into 5 categories: framework or architecture proposals, model proposals, technique proposals, comparison services, and tool proposals. The most frequent type of contribution is the proposal of a framework or architecture to enable semantic interoperability. Conclusions: This SMR provides a classification of the different solutions proposed to address semantic interoperability using FHIR at different levels: collecting, extracting and annotating data, modeling electronic health record data from legacy systems, and applying transformation and mapping to FHIR models and terminologies. The use of ML and NLP for unstructured data is promising and has been applied to specific use case scenarios. In addition, terminology services are needed to accelerate their use and adoption; furthermore, techniques and tools to automate annotation and ontology comparison should help reduce human interaction. ©Fouzia Amar, Alain April, Alain Abran.

This field guide attempts to clarify working definitions and conceptual boundaries within the lexicon of U.S. healthcare reform efforts that predated and have common thematic perspectives within the evolving VBH reform paradigm. Data Sources: Pubmed/MEDLINE/Google search. Review Methods: Pubmed/MEDLINE/Google search was performed during August 1, 2020-January14, 2021 for U.S. healthcare reform terms, legislative and government agency publications. Those citing relevant legislative, regulatory, philosophical and technological advancements integral to the development and function of VBH were catalogued according to the targeted stakeholders and evolving reform strategy or technology. Conclusions: Eight healthcare reform paradigms were identified as influential precursors to VBH: Patient-Centered Care Model, Patient-Centered Medical Home, Population Health, Personalized Medicine, P4 Medicine, Precision Medicine, Managed Care, and Accountable Care. Several of these models have similar nomenclature and, confusingly, many have multiple interpretations of the terms used to describe these models. However, consistent stakeholders identified within these paradigms are key to VBH; notably the patient, the physician and the payer (the “Big 3”). Demonstrable healthcare spending reductions have been best achieved when the Big 3 stakeholder interests are aligned within healthcare reform legislation. The definition of “Value” within each reform model was found to be based upon the perspective of the targeted stakeholder. Within VBH, the perspectives of the Big 3 stakeholders form a multidimensional meaning of “Value” that can be represented by the equation Value = Patient Experience Management3. © 2021 The Authors.

Objectives: There is growing interest in the use of biomedical informatics and data analytics tools in spine surgery. Yet despite the rapid growth in research on these topics, few analytic tools have been implemented in routine spine practice. The purpose of this review is to provide a health information technology (HIT) roadmap to help translate data assets and analytics tools into measurable advances in spine surgical care. Methods: We conducted a narrative review of PubMed and Google Scholar to identify publications discussing data assets, analytical approaches, and implementation strategies relevant to spine surgery practice. Results: A variety of data assets are available for spine research, ranging from commonly used datasets, such as administrative billing data, to emerging resources, such as mobile health and biobanks. Both regression and machine learning techniques are valuable for analyzing these assets, and researchers should recognize the particular strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Few studies have focused on the implementation of HIT, and a variety of methods exist to help translate analytic tools into clinically useful interventions. Finally, a number of HIT-related challenges must be recognized and addressed, including stakeholder acceptance, regulatory oversight, and ethical considerations. Conclusions: Biomedical informatics has the potential to support the development of new HIT that can improve spine surgery quality and outcomes. By understanding the development life-cycle that includes identifying an appropriate data asset, selecting an analytic approach, and leveraging an effective implementation strategy, spine researchers can translate this potential into measurable advances in patient care. © The Author(s) 2021.",big data; spine surgery; biomedical informatics; data analytics; health information technology; implementation science; machine learning,adult; big data; biobank; female; human; implementation science; information science; language; life cycle; machine learning; male; medical information; Medline; narrative; patient care; review; search engine; spine surgery; systematic review,SAGE Publications Ltd,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

In primary care, reduced SA among physicians increases errors in clinical decision-making and, correspondingly, patients’ risk of experiencing adverse outcomes. Our objective was to understand the extent to which electronic health records (EHRs) support primary care physicians (PCPs)’ SA during clinical decision-making. Method: We conducted a metanarrative review of papers in selected academic databases, including CINAHL and MEDLINE. Eligible studies included original peer-reviewed research published between January 2012 and August 2020 on PCP–EHR interactions. We iteratively queried, screened, and summarized literature focused on EHRs supporting PCPs’ clinical decision-making and care management for adults. Then, we mapped findings to an established SA framework to classify external factors (individual, task, and system) affecting PCPs’ levels of SA (1–Perception, 2–Comprehension, and 3–Projection) and identified SA barriers. Results: From 1504 articles identified, we included and synthesized 19 studies. Study designs were largely noninterventional. Studies described EHR workflow misalignments, usability issues, and communication challenges. EHR information, including lab results and care plans, was characterized as incomplete, untimely, or irrelevant. Unmet information needs made it difficult for PCPs to obtain even basic SA, Level 1 SA. Prevalent barriers to PCPs developing SA with EHRs were errant mental models, attentional tunneling, and data overload. Conclusion: Based on our review, EHRs do not support the development of higher levels of SA among PCPs. Review findings suggest SA-oriented design processes for health information technology could improve PCPs’ SA, satisfaction, and decision-making. © Copyright 2020, The Author(s).",cognition; decision-making; electronic health record; primary care; safety; situation awareness,"Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; Awareness; Communication; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Physicians, Primary Care; Behavioral research; eHealth; Iterative methods; Records management; Adverse outcomes; Clinical decision making; Cognition; Decisions makings; Dynamic environments; Electronic health; Electronic health record; Health records; Primary care; Situation awareness; adult; awareness; Cinahl; clinical decision making; cognitive model; comprehension; electronic health record; female; general practitioner; human; human experiment; male; medical information; Medline; perception; review; satisfaction; usability; workflow; awareness; electronic health record; health personnel attitude; interpersonal communication; Decision making",SAGE Publications Inc.,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access

The quickly evolving field of medical informatics research has contributed numerous concepts, algorithms, and standards to facilitate this development. However, these difficult relationships, complex terminologies, and multiple implementations can present obstacles for people who want to get active in the field. With a particular focus on medical informatics research conducted in Germany, we present in our Viewpoint a set of 10 important topics to improve the overall interdisciplinary communication between different stakeholders (eg, physicians, computational experts, experimentalists, students, patient representatives). This may lower the barriers to entry and offer a starting point for collaborations at different levels. The suggested topics are briefly introduced, then general best practice guidance is given, and further resources for in-depth reading or hands-on tutorials are recommended. In addition, the topics are set to cover current aspects and open research gaps of the medical informatics domain, including data regulations and concepts; data harmonization and processing; and data evaluation, visualization, and dissemination. In addition, we give an example on how these topics can be integrated in a medical informatics curriculum for higher education. By recognizing these topics, readers will be able to (1) set clinical and research data into the context of medical informatics, understanding what is possible to achieve with data or how data should be handled in terms of data privacy and storage; (2) distinguish current interoperability standards and obtain first insights into the processes leading to effective data transfer and analysis; and (3) value the use of newly developed technical approaches to utilize the full potential of clinical data. ©Markus Wolfien, Najia Ahmadi, Kai Fitzer, Sophia Grummt, Kilian-Ludwig Heine, Ian-C Jung, Dagmar Krefting, Andreas Kühn, Yuan Peng, Ines Reinecke, Julia Scheel, Tobias Schmidt, Paul Schmücker, Christina Schüttler, Dagmar Waltemath, Michele Zoch, Martin Sedlmayr.",clinical data; digital health; health informatics; interdisciplinary communication; medical informatics; research data,Algorithms; Curriculum; Germany; Humans; Medical Informatics; adult; curriculum; data privacy; Germany; human; interdisciplinary communication; medical informatics; nomenclature; physician; research gap; review; tertiary education; algorithm,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

The DDI between warfarin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is common and potentially life-threatening. Patients can play a substantial role in preventing harm from DDIs; however, the current model for DDI decision-making is clinician centric. Objective: This study aims to design and study the usability of DDInteract, a tool to support shared decision-making (SDM) between a patient and provider for the DDI between warfarin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Methods: We used an SDM framework and user-centered design methods to guide the design and usability of DDInteract - an SDM electronic health record app to prevent harm from clinically significant DDIs. The design involved iterative prototypes, qualitative feedback from stakeholders, and a heuristic evaluation. The usability evaluation included patients and clinicians. Patients participated in a simulated SDM discussion using clinical vignettes. Clinicians were asked to complete eight tasks using DDInteract and to assess the tool using a survey adapted from the System Usability Scale. Results: The designed DDInteract prototype includes the following features: a patient-specific risk profile, dynamic risk icon array, patient education section, and treatment decision tree. A total of 4 patients and 11 clinicians participated in the usability study. After an SDM session where patients and clinicians review the tool concurrently, patients generally favored pain treatments with less risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Clinicians successfully completed the tasks with a mean of 144 (SD 74) seconds and rated the usability of DDInteract as 4.32 (SD 0.52) of 5. Conclusions: This study expands the use of SDM to DDIs. The next steps are to determine if DDInteract can improve shared decision-making quality and to implement it across health systems using interoperable technology.  ©Thomas J Reese, Guilherme Del Fiol, Keaton Morgan, Jason T Hurwitz, Kensaku Kawamoto, Ainhoa Gomez-Lumbreras, Mary L Brown, Henrik Thiess, Sara R Vazquez, Scott D Nelson, Richard Boyce, Daniel Malone.",Clinical decision support; Drug interaction; Shared decision-making; User-centered design,,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access
96,Yin R.; Law K.; Neyens D.,Examining how internet users trust and access electronic health record patient portals: Survey study,2021,JMIR Human Factors,5.0,10.2196/28501,"Background: Electronic health record (EHR) patient portals are designed to provide medical health records to patients. Using an EHR portal is expected to contribute to positive health outcomes and facilitate patient-provider communication. Objective: Our objective was to examine how portal users report using their portals and the factors associated with obtaining health information from the internet. We also examined the desired portal features, factors impacting users’ trust in portals, and barriers to using portals. Methods: An internet-based survey study was conducted using Amazon Mechanical Turk. All the participants were adults in the United States who used patient portals. The survey included questions about how the participants used their portals, what factors acted as barriers to using their portals, and how they used and how much they trusted other web-based health information sources as well as their portals. A logistic regression model was used to examine the factors influencing the participants’ trust in their portals. Additionally, the desired features and design characteristics were identified to support the design of future portals. Results: A total of 394 participants completed the survey. Most of the participants were less than 35 years old (212/394, 53.8%), with 36.3% (143/394) aged between 35 and 55 years, and 9.9% (39/394) aged above 55 years. Women accounted for 48.5% (191/394) of the survey participants. More than 78% (307/394) of the participants reported using portals at least monthly. The most common portal features used were viewing lab results, making appointments, and paying bills. Participants reported some barriers to portal use including data security and limited access to the internet. The results of a logistic regression model used to predict the trust in their portals suggest that those comfortable using their portals (odds ratio [OR] 7.97, 95% CI 1.11-57.32) thought that their portals were easy to use (OR 7.4, 95% CI 1.12-48.84), and frequent internet users (OR 43.72, 95% CI 1.83-1046.43) were more likely to trust their portals. Participants reporting that the portals were important in managing their health (OR 28.13, 95% CI 5.31-148.85) and that their portals were a valuable part of their health care (OR 6.75, 95% CI 1.51-30.11) were also more likely to trust their portals. Conclusions: There are several factors that impact the trust of EHR patient portal users in their portals. Designing easily usable portals and considering these factors may be the most effective approach to improving trust in patient portals. The desired features and usability of portals are critical factors that contribute to users’ trust in EHR portals. ©Rong Yin, Katherine Law, David Neyens.",Consumer health informatics; Electronic health records; Internet; Logistic model; Participatory medicine; Patient portal; Questionnaires; Surveys,,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

However, most of these data are collected for clinical use rather than for retrospective analysis. This means that researchers typically face many different issues when attempting to access and prepare the data for secondary use. We aimed to investigate how raw EHRs can be accessed and prepared in retrospective data science projects in a disciplined, effective, and efficient way. We report our experience and findings from a large-scale data science project analyzing routinely acquired retrospective data from the Kepler University Hospital in Linz, Austria. The project involved data collection from more than 150,000 patients over a period of 10 years. It included diverse data modalities, such as static demographic data, irregularly acquired laboratory test results, regularly sampled vital signs, and high-frequency physiological waveform signals. Raw medical data can be corrupted in many unexpected ways that demand thorough manual inspection and highly individualized data cleaning solutions. We present a general data preparation workflow, which was shaped in the course of our project and consists of the following 7 steps: obtain a rough overview of the available EHR data, define clinically meaningful labels for supervised learning, extract relevant data from the hospital’s data warehouses, match data extracted from different sources, deidentify them, detect errors and inconsistencies therein through a careful exploratory analysis, and implement a suitable data processing pipeline in actual code. Only few of the data preparation issues encountered in our project were addressed by generic medical data preprocessing tools that have been proposed recently. Instead, highly individualized solutions for the specific data used in one’s own research seem inevitable. We believe that the proposed workflow can serve as a guidance for practitioners, helping them to identify and address potential problems early and avoid some common pitfalls. ©Alexander Maletzky, Carl Böck, Thomas Tschoellitsch, Theresa Roland, Helga Ludwig, Stefan Thumfart, Michael Giretzlehner, Sepp Hochreiter, Jens Meier.",electronic health record; machine learning; medical data preparation; retrospective data analysis,,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

Although the clinical implications of AI in EHR systems have been extensively analyzed, its application in HIE as a crucial source of patient data is less explored. Addressing this gap, our systematic review delves into utilizing AI models in HIE, gauging their predictive prowess and potential limitations. Employing databases such as Scopus, CINAHL, Google Scholar, PubMed/Medline, and Web of Science and adhering to the PRISMA guidelines, we unearthed 1021 publications. Of these, 11 were shortlisted for the final analysis. A noticeable preference for machine learning models in prognosticating clinical results, notably in oncology and cardiac failures, was evident. The metrics displayed AUC values ranging between 61% and 99.91%. Sensitivity metrics spanned from 12% to 96.50%, specificity from 76.30% to 98.80%, positive predictive values varied from 83.70% to 94.10%, and negative predictive values between 94.10% and 99.10%. Despite variations in specific metrics, AI models drawing on HIE data unfailingly showcased commendable predictive proficiency in clinical verdicts, emphasizing the transformative potential of melding AI with HIE. However, variations in sensitivity highlight underlying challenges. As healthcare’s path becomes more enmeshed with AI, a well-rounded, enlightened approach is pivotal to guarantee the delivery of trustworthy and effective AI-augmented healthcare solutions. © 2023 by the authors.",artificial intelligence; electronic health record; health information exchange; machine learning,,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access
99,Nan J.; Xu L.-Q.,Designing Interoperable Health Care Services Based on Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources: Literature Review,2023,JMIR Medical Informatics,5.0,10.2196/44842,"Background: With the advent of the digital economy and the aging population, the demand for diversified health care services and innovative care delivery models has been overwhelming. This trend has accelerated the urgency to implement effective and efficient data exchange and service interoperability, which underpins coordinated care services among tiered health care institutions, improves the quality of oversight of regulators, and provides vast and comprehensive data collection to support clinical medicine and health economics research, thus improving the overall service quality and patient satisfaction. To meet this demand and facilitate the interoperability of IT systems of stakeholders, after years of preparation, Health Level 7 formally introduced, in 2014, the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. It has since continued to evolve. FHIR depends on the Implementation Guide (IG) to ensure feasibility and consistency while developing an interoperable health care service. The IG defines rules with associated documentation on how FHIR resources are used to tackle a particular problem. However, a gap remains between IGs and the process of building actual services because IGs are rules without specifying concrete methods, procedures, or tools. Thus, stakeholders may feel it nontrivial to participate in the ecosystem, giving rise to the need for a more actionable practice guideline (PG) for promoting FHIR’s fast adoption. Objective: This study aimed to propose a general FHIR PG to facilitate stakeholders in the health care ecosystem to understand FHIR and quickly develop interoperable health care services. Methods: We selected a collection of FHIR-related papers about the latest studies or use cases on designing and building FHIR-based interoperable health care services and tagged each use case as belonging to 1 of the 3 dominant innovation feature groups that are also associated with practice stages, that is, data standardization, data management, and data integration. Next, we reviewed each group’s detailed process and key techniques to build respective care services and collate a complete FHIR PG. Finally, as an example, we arbitrarily selected a use case outside the scope of the reviewed papers and mapped it back to the FHIR PG to demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of the PG. Results: The FHIR PG includes 2 core elements: one is a practice design that defines the responsibilities of stakeholders and outlines the complete procedure from data to services, and the other is a development architecture for practice design, which lists the available tools for each practice step and provides direct and actionable recommendations. Conclusions: The FHIR PG can bridge the gap between IGs and the process of building actual services by proposing actionable methods, procedures, and tools. It assists stakeholders in identifying participants’ roles, managing the scope of responsibilities, and developing relevant modules, thus helping promote FHIR-based interoperable health care services. © Jingwen Nan, Li-Qun Xu.","Health level 7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, HL7 FHIR; interoperability; literature review; mobile phone; practice guideline",,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

However, patient safety officers and analysts in healthcare systems and safety organizations are challenged to make sense of the ever-increasing volume of PSE reports, including the free-text narratives. As a result, there is a growing emphasis on applying text mining and natural language processing (NLP) approaches to assist in the processing and understanding of these narratives. Although text mining and NLP in healthcare have advanced significantly over the past decades, the utility of the resulting models, ontologies, and algorithms to analyze PSE narratives are limited given the unique difference and challenges in content and language between PSE narratives and clinical documentation. To promote the application of text mining and NLP for PSE narratives, these unique challenges must be addressed. Improving data access, developing NLP resources to practically use contributing factor taxonomies, and developing and adopting shared specifications for interoperability will help create an infrastructure and environment that unlocks the collaborative potential between patient safety, research, and machine learning communities, in the development of reproducible and generalizable methods and models to better understand and improve patient safety and patient care.

Objectives of this study were, therefore, to (1) identify the proportion of randomized controlled trials with CDS interventions that were complex, (2) describe common gaps in the reporting of complexity in CDS research, and (3) determine the impact of increased complexity on CDS effectiveness. Materials and Methods: To assess CDS complexity and identify reporting gaps for characterizing CDS interventions, we used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses reporting tool for complex interventions. We evaluated the effect of increased complexity using random-effects meta-analysis. Results: Most included studies evaluated a complex CDS intervention (76%). No studies described use of analytical frameworks or causal pathways. Two studies discussed use of theory but only one fully described the rationale and put it in context of a behavior change. A small but positive effect (standardized mean difference, 0.147; 95% CI, 0.039-0.255; P <. 01) in favor of increasing intervention complexity was observed. Discussion: While most CDS studies should classify interventions as complex, opportunities persist for documenting and providing resources in a manner that would enable CDS interventions to be replicated and adapted. Unless reporting of the design, implementation, and evaluation of CDS interventions improves, only slight benefits can be expected. Conclusion: Conceptualizing CDS as complex interventions may help convey the careful attention that is needed to ensure these interventions are contextually and theoretically informed.  © 2022 The Author(s).

However, these data are frequently unavailable or present in a format that requires substantial revision. This article reports the results of a review of informatics literature published from 2010 to 2016 that addresses these issues by identifying categories of data content that might be included or revised in the EHR. Materials and Methods We used an iterative review process on 1,215 biomedical informatics research articles. We placed them into generic categories, reviewed and refined the categories, and then assigned additional articles, for a total of three iterations. Results Our process identified eight categories of data content issues: Adverse Events, Clinician Cognitive Processes, Data Standards Creation and Data Communication, Genomics, Medication List Data Capture, Patient Preferences, Patient-reported Data, and Phenotyping. Discussion These categories summarize discussions in biomedical informatics literature that concern data content issues restricting clinical informatics research. These barriers to research result from data that are either absent from the EHR or are inadequate (e.g., in narrative text form) for the downstream applications of the data. In light of these categories, we discuss changes to EHR data storage that should be considered in the redesign of EHRs, to promote continued innovation in clinical informatics. Conclusion Based on published literature of clinical informaticians’ reuse of EHR data, we characterize eight types of data content that, if included in the next generation of EHRs, would find immediate application in advanced informatics tools and techniques.

With adoption of EHRs came the promise of improved efficiency, higher-quality care, and lower costs. Unfortunately, some clinicians are now spending twice as much time on documentation as they spend seeing patients, and the documentation paradigm of problem-oriented medical records is contributing to this imbalance. It is time to consider new innovations. The collaborative wiki format offers many opportunities to ease the burden of documentation as well as to increase the usefulness of the recorded clinical data. Wikis support multiple authorship, have built-in features to track edits and changes, allow for contextual linkages (e.g., linking medical problems to their treatment), and support new technologies such as application programming interfaces, which allow for safe and secure exchange of information. In this Perspective, the authors describe the rationale for considering this approach to clinical documentation and propose a pilot to learn about its effectiveness. They believe wiki-based documentation will become increasingly attractive, especially as new legislation and directives from policymakers seek to reduce the crushing documentation burden and as the U.S. health care system transitions from an episode-based payment structure to a value-based, outcomes-focused system.

Randomized controlled trials are the gold standard for drug development and performance evaluation. However, when the drug is applied outside the controlled environment, the outcomes may differ in patient populations. In this context, the need to understand the macro and micro changes involved in disease evolution and progression becomes important and so is the need for harvesting and harnessing the real-world data from various resources to use them in generating real-world evidence. Digital tools with potential relevance to rheumatology can potentially be leveraged to obtain greater patient insights, greater information on disease progression and disease micro processes and even in the early diagnosis of diseases.

One important research application of EHRs is the identification of biomarkers associated with specific patient states, especially within complex conditions. However, using EHRs for biomarker identification can be challenging because the EHR was not designed with research as the primary focus. Despite this challenge, the EHR offers huge potential for biomarker discovery research to transform our understanding of disease etiology and treatment and generate biological insights informing precision medicine initiatives. This review paper provides an in-depth analysis of how EHR data is currently used for phenotyping and identifying molecular biomarkers, current challenges and limitations, and strategies we can take to mitigate challenges going forward. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",biomarker discovery; electronic health records; phenotyping; precision medicine,Biomarkers; Biomedical Research; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Precision Medicine; biological marker; biological marker; diagnostic imaging; digital imaging; electronic health record; human; medical research; Review; selection bias; medical research; personalized medicine,Elsevier Ltd,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access

The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) data standard has been increasingly applied in developing these systems. However, methods for applying FHIR to ML-CISs are variable. Objective: This study evaluates and compares the functionalities, strengths, and weaknesses of existing systems and proposes guidelines for optimizing future work with ML-CISs. Methods: Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science were searched for articles describing machine learning systems that were used for clinical data analytics or decision support in compliance with FHIR standards. Information regarding each system’s functionality, data sources, formats, security, performance, resource requirements, scalability, strengths, and limitations was compared across systems. Results: A total of 39 articles describing FHIR-based ML-CISs were divided into the following three categories according to their primary focus: clinical decision support systems (n=18), data management and analytic platforms (n=10), or auxiliary modules and application programming interfaces (n=11). Model strengths included novel use of cloud systems, Bayesian networks, visualization strategies, and techniques for translating unstructured or free-text data to FHIR frameworks. Many intelligent systems lacked electronic health record interoperability and externally validated evidence of clinical efficacy. Conclusions: Shortcomings in current ML-CISs can be addressed by incorporating modular and interoperable data management, analytic platforms, secure interinstitutional data exchange, and application programming interfaces with adequate scalability to support both real-time and prospective clinical applications that use electronic health record platforms with diverse implementations. © 2023 The Author(s).",clinical decision support system; clinical informatics; decision support; Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources; FHIR; information systems; interoperability; interoperable; machine learning; ontologies; ontology; review methodology; review methods; scoping review,,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

In Brazil, EHR development must follow specific standards, laws, and guidelines that contribute to implementing beneficial resources for population health monitoring. This paper presents an audit of the main approaches used for EHR development in Brazil, thus highlighting prospects, challenges, and existing gaps in the field. We applied a systematic review protocol to search for articles published from 2011 to 2021 in seven databases (Science Direct, Web of Science, PubMed, Springer, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and SciELO). Subsequently, we analyzed 14 articles that met the inclusion and quality criteria and answered our research questions. According to this analysis, 78.58% (11) of the articles state that interoperability between systems is essential for improving patient care. Moreover, many resources are being designed and deployed to achieve this communication between EHRs and other healthcare systems in the Brazilian landscape. Besides interoperability, the articles report other considerable elements: (i) the need for increased security with the deployment of permission resources for viewing patient data, (ii) the absence of accurate data for testing EHRs, and (iii) the relevance of defining a methodology for EHR development. Our review provides an overview of EHR development in Brazil and discusses current gaps, innovative approaches, and technological solutions that could potentially address the related challenges. Lastly, our study also addresses primary elements that could contribute to relevant components of EHR development in the context of Brazil's public health system.

However, it is also a box with (probably more than) seven locks: laboratories use their own internal coding systems, results are reported in different languages (four official languages plus English with very distinct features in Switzerland), report formats are not uniform, standard nomenclature (e.g. Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes [LOINC]) is not routinely used and even these coding systems lack important information, including data, for example, about the specific ""kit""used for testing or preanalytical procedures affecting the sample quality and result interpretability. Visualization of complex laboratory and reporting ""-omics""data are additional challenges. Currently, there is no ""passepartout""key for all these locks available, and also newer concepts such as Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR) might not provide enough plasticity to unconditionally render laboratory data interoperable.

This systematic review investigates the design, effectiveness, and economic outcomes of CDS targeting several common chronic diseases. Material and Methods: We conducted a search in PubMed (Medline), EBSCOHOST (CINAHL, APA PsychInfo, EconLit), and Web of Science. We limited the search to studies from 2011 to 2021. Studies were included if the CDS was electronic health record-based and targeted one or more of the following chronic diseases: cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. Studies with effectiveness or economic outcomes were considered for inclusion, and a meta-analysis was conducted. Results: The review included 76 studies with effectiveness outcomes and 9 with economic outcomes. Of the effectiveness studies, 63% described a positive outcome that favored the CDS intervention group. However, meta-analysis demonstrated that effect sizes were heterogenous and small, with limited clinical and statistical significance. Of the economic studies, most full economic evaluations (n = 5) used a modeled analysis approach. Cost-effectiveness of CDS varied widely between studies, with an estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ranging between USD$2192 to USD$151 955 per QALY. Conclusion: We summarize contemporary chronic disease CDS designs and evaluation results. The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness results for CDS interventions are highly heterogeneous, likely due to differences in implementation context and evaluation methodology. Improved quality of reporting, particularly from modeled economic evaluations, would assist decision makers to better interpret and utilize results from these primary research studies.

It is recognised that implementing genomics within a health service is challenging without a system-wide approach. Globally, as clinical genomics implementation programs have matured there is a growing body of information around program design and outcomes. Program structures vary depending on local ecosystems including the health system, politics and funding availability, however, lessons from other programs are important to the design of programs in different jurisdictions. Here we describe an adaptive approach to the implementation of genomics into a publicly funded health care system servicing a population of 5.1 million people. The adaptive approach enabled flexibility to facilitate substantial changes during the program in response to learnings and external factors.

Wearable monitors and artificial intelligence–based decision support systems could be integrated with hospital-based digital health systems such as electronic health records (EHRs) to provide higher level care at a relatively low cost. However, the appropriate and sustainable application of these innovations in low- and middle-income countries requires an understanding of the local government’s requirements and regulations such as technology specifications, cybersecurity, data-sharing protocols, and interoperability. Objective: This scoping review aims to explore the current state of digital health research and the policies that govern the adoption of digital health systems in Vietnamese hospitals. Methods: We conducted a scoping review using a modification of the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. PubMed and Web of Science were searched for academic publications, and Th Vi n Pháp Lu t, a proprietary database of Vietnamese government documents, and the Vietnam Electronic Health Administration website were searched for government documents. Google Scholar and Google Search were used for snowballing searches. The sources were assessed against predefined eligibility criteria through title, abstract, and full-text screening. Relevant information from the included sources was charted and summarized. The review process was primarily undertaken by one researcher and reviewed by another researcher during each step. Results: In total, 11 academic publications and 20 government documents were included in this review. Among the academic studies, 5 reported engineering solutions for information systems in hospitals, 2 assessed readiness for EHR implementation, 1 tested physicians’ performance before and after using clinical decision support software, 1 reported a national laboratory information management system, and 2 reviewed the health system’s capability to implement eHealth and artificial intelligence. Of the 20 government documents, 19 were promulgated from 2013 to 2020. These regulations and guidance cover a wide range of digital health domains, including hospital information management systems, general and interoperability standards, cybersecurity in health organizations, conditions for the provision of health information technology (HIT), electronic health insurance claims, laboratory information systems, HIT maturity, digital health strategies, electronic medical records, EHRs, and eHealth architectural frameworks. Conclusions: Research about hospital-based digital health systems in Vietnam is very limited, particularly implementation studies. Government regulations and guidance for HIT in health care organizations have been released with increasing frequency since 2013, targeting a variety of information systems such as electronic medical records, EHRs, and laboratory information systems. In general, these policies were focused on the basic specifications and standards that digital health systems need to meet. More research is needed in the future to guide the implementation of digital health care systems in the Vietnam hospital setting. ©Duc Minh Tran, C Louise Thwaites, Jennifer Ilo Van Nuil, Jacob McKnight, An Phuoc Luu, Chris Paton",Administrative information; Compulsory; Data; Digital health; EHealth; Electronic medical records; Health; Health insurance ID; Hospital care; Mobile phone; Patient ID; Policy; Standards; Vietnam,"Artificial Intelligence; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Health Policy; Hospitals; Humans; Vietnam; artificial intelligence; computer security; decision support system; digital technology; electronic health record; electronic medical record; eligibility criteria; government regulation; health care organization; health care policy; health care system; health insurance; health program; hospital care; hospital information system; medical informatics; medical information system; medical research; Medline; physician; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; Review; search engine; telehealth; Viet Nam; Web of Science; artificial intelligence; clinical decision support system; health care policy; hospital; human; Viet Nam",JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

Clinical decision support (CDS) refers to digital tools that present providers with clinically relevant information and recommendations, which have been shown to improve test utilization. Nevertheless, individual CDS applications often fail, and implementation remains challenging. CONTENT: We review common classes of CDS tools grounded in examples from the literature as well as our own institutional experience. In addition, we present a practical framework and specific recommendations for effective CDS implementation. SUMMARY: CDS encompasses a rich set of tools that have the potential to drive significant improvements in laboratory testing, especially with respect to test utilization. Deploying CDS effectively requires thoughtful design and careful maintenance, and structured processes focused on quality improvement and change management play an important role in achieving these goals. © American Association for Clinical Chemistry 2021.

However, AI tools have not yet been widely successful. One of the key reason is the COVID-19 pandemic has demanded faster real-time development of AI-driven clinical and health support tools, including rapid data collection, algorithm development, validation, and deployment. However, there was not enough time for proper data quality control. Learning from the hard lessons in COVID-19, we summarize the important health data quality challenges during COVID-19 pandemic such as lack of data standardization, missing data, tabulation errors, and noise and artifact. Then we conduct a systematic investigation of computational methods that address these issues, including emerging novel advanced AI data quality control methods that achieve better data quality outcomes and, in some cases, simplify or automate the data cleaning process. We hope this article can assist healthcare community to improve health data quality going forward with novel AI development.  © 2008-2011 IEEE.",artificial intelligence algorithm development; COVID-19 pandemic; data harmonization; Data quality; deep learning; missing data; noise and artifact; quality control; tabular errors,Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; COVID-19; Data Accuracy; Humans; Pandemics; Cleaning; Data reduction; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Health care; Medical imaging; Quality assurance; Quality control; Systematic errors; Algorithms development; Artificial intelligence algorithm development; Artificial intelligence algorithms; COVID-19 pandemic; Data harmonization; Data integrity; Data quality; Deep learning; Medical diagnostic imaging; Missing data; Noise and artifact; Pandemic; Tabular error; algorithm; artifact; artificial intelligence; cleaning; coronavirus disease 2019; data integrity; data quality; deep learning; diagnostic imaging; health data; human; learning; pandemic; quality control; Review; standardization; measurement accuracy; pandemic; COVID-19,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access

In designing RCTs of EHR interventions, one should carefully consider the unit of randomization (for example, patient, encounter, clinician, or clinical unit), balancing concerns about contamination of an intervention across randomization units within clusters (for example, patients within clinical units) against the superior control of measured and unmeasured confounders that comes with randomizing a larger number of units. One should also consider whether the key computational assessment components of the EHR intervention, such as a predictive algorithm used to target a subgroup for decision support, should occur before randomization (so that only 1 subgroup is randomized) or after randomization (including all subgroups). When these components are applied after randomization, one must consider expected heterogeneity in the effect of the differential decision support across subgroups, which has implications for overall impact potential, analytic approach, and sample size planning. Trials of EHR interventions should be reviewed by an institutional review board, but may not require patient-level informed consent when the interventions being tested can be considered minimal risk or quality improvement, and when clinical decision making is supported, rather than controlled, by an EHR intervention. Data and safety monitoring for RCTs of EHR interventions should be conducted to guide institutional pragmatic decision making about implementation and ensure that continuing randomization remains justified. Reporting should follow the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) Statement, with extensions for pragmatic trials and cluster RCTs when applicable, and should include detailed materials to enhance reproducibility. © 2020 American College of Physicians.

EC diagnosed at advanced stages shows a poor therapeutic response. The clinically utilized EC diagnostic approaches are costly, time-consuming, and are not readily available to all patients. The rapid growth in computational biology has enticed substantial research attention from both data scientists and oncologists, leading to the development of rapid and cost-effective computer-aided cancer surveillance systems. Machine learning (ML), a subcategory of artificial intelligence, provides opportunities for drug discovery, early cancer diagnosis, effective treatment, and choice of treatment modalities. The application of ML approaches in EC diagnosis, therapies, and prognosis may be particularly relevant. Considering the significance of customized treatment and the growing trend of using ML approaches in cancer prediction and monitoring, a critical survey of ML utility in EC may provide impetus research in EC and assist oncologists, molecular biologists, biomedical engineers, and bioinformaticians to further collaborative research in EC.

Despite increased availability of electronic health records and the ongoing development of new CDS technologies, uptake of CDS into routine clinical settings is inconsistent. This qualitative systematic review seeks to synthesise healthcare provider experiences of CDS—exploring the barriers and enablers to implementing, using, evaluating, and sustaining chronic disease CDS systems. Methods: A search was conducted in Medline, CINAHL, APA PsychInfo, EconLit, and Web of Science from 2011 to 2021. Primary research studies incorporating qualitative findings were included if they targeted healthcare providers and studied a relevant chronic disease CDS intervention. Relevant CDS interventions were electronic health record-based and addressed one or more of the following chronic diseases: cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and hypercholesterolaemia. Qualitative findings were synthesised using a meta-aggregative approach. Results: Thirty-three primary research articles were included in this qualitative systematic review. Meta-aggregation of qualitative data revealed 177 findings and 29 categories, which were aggregated into 8 synthesised findings. The synthesised findings related to clinical context, user, external context, and technical factors affecting CDS uptake. Key barriers to uptake included CDS systems that were simplistic, had limited clinical applicability in multimorbidity, and integrated poorly into existing workflows. Enablers to successful CDS interventions included perceived usefulness in providing relevant clinical knowledge and structured chronic disease care; user confidence gained through training and post training follow-up; external contexts comprised of strong clinical champions, allocated personnel, and technical support; and CDS technical features that are both highly functional, and attractive. Conclusion: This systematic review explored healthcare provider experiences, focussing on barriers and enablers to CDS use for chronic diseases. The results provide an evidence-base for designing, implementing, and sustaining future CDS systems. Based on the findings from this review, we highlight actionable steps for practice and future research.

EHR trajectories, the temporal aspect of health records, facilitate predicting patients’ future health-related risks. It enables healthcare systems to increase the quality of care through early identification and primary prevention. Deep learning techniques have shown great capacity for analyzing complex data and have been successful for prediction tasks using complex EHR trajectories. This systematic review aims to analyze recent studies to identify challenges, knowledge gaps, and ongoing research directions. Methods: For this systematic review, we searched Scopus, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and ACM databases from Jan 2016 to April 2022 using search terms centered around EHR, deep learning, and trajectories. Then the selected papers were analyzed according to publication characteristics, objectives, and their solutions regarding existing challenges, such as the model's capacity to deal with intricate data dependencies, data insufficiency, and explainability. Results: : After removing duplicates and out-of-scope papers, 63 papers were selected, which showed rapid growth in the number of research in recent years. Predicting all diseases in the next visit and the onset of cardiovascular diseases were the most common targets. Different contextual and non-contextual representation learning methods are employed to retrieve important information from the sequence of EHR trajectories. Recurrent neural networks and the time-aware attention mechanism for modeling long-term dependencies, self-attentions, convolutional neural networks, graphs for representing inner visit relations, and attention scores for explainability were frequently used among the reviewed publications. Conclusions: This systematic review demonstrated how recent breakthroughs in deep learning methods have facilitated the modeling of EHR trajectories. Research on improving the ability of graph neural networks, attention mechanisms, and cross-modal learning to analyze intricate dependencies among EHRs has shown good progress. There is a need to increase the number of publicly available EHR trajectory datasets to allow for easier comparison among different models.

Patient-centered care is gaining international acceptance with the patient taking greater responsibility for his/her health and sharing decision making for the diagnosis and management of illness. Laboratory medicine must embrace this change and work in a tripartite collaboration with patients and with the clinicians who use clinical laboratory services. Improved communication is the key to participation, including the provision of educational information and support. Knowledge management should be targeted to each stakeholder group. As part of collaborative healthcare clinical laboratory service provision needs to be more flexible and available, with implications for managers who oversee the structure and governance of the service. Increased use of managed point of care testing will be essential. The curriculum content of laboratory medicine training programs will require trainees to undertake practice-based learning that facilitates interaction with patients, clinicians and managers.

Over the past 35 years, the number of cardiovascular registries has skyrocketed, and their use will only continue to grow as data on novel procedures and devices will need to be collected and analyzed. The American College of Cardiology and Society of Thoracic Surgeons Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry is just one example of a modern registry that plays a crucial role in collecting data on patients undergoing transcatheter valvular procedures. Through public reporting registries, data can be shared on a hospital and provider level for many quality performance measures. There remains much work to be done on allowing automated data extraction from the electronic medical record directly into registries. No matter how sophisticated and complete a registry is, it can never overcome the problem of treatment selection bias that is inherent in observational data.

As it progresses, patients become increasingly dependent, and their caregivers are burdened with the increasing demand for managing their care. Mobile health (mHealth) technology, such as smartphone applications, can support the need of these caregivers. This paper examines the published academic literature of mHealth applications that support the caregivers of AD patients. Following the PRISMA for scoping reviews, we searched published literature in five electronic databases between January 2014 and January 2021. Twelve articles were included in the final review. Six themes emerged based on the functionalities provided by the reviewed applications for caregivers. They are tracking, task management, monitoring, caregiver mental support, education, and caregiver communication platform. The review revealed that mHealth applications for AD patients’ caregivers are inadequate. There is an opportunity for industry, government, and academia to fill the unmet need of these caregiver. © 2021, The Author(s).",,Neurodegenerative diseases; Academic literature; Alzheimer; Chronic disease; Electronic database; Health technology; Mobile health application; Neurodegenerative; Scoping review; Smart-phone applications; Task management; Alzheimer disease; caregiver; caregiver burden; education; empowerment; human; interpersonal communication; mental health; monitoring; patient care; Review; mHealth,Nature Research,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

More convenient, less invasive monitoring devices, including patches, wearables, and biosensors, now allow for continuous physiological data to be gleaned from patients in a variety of care settings across the perioperative experience. These data can be bound into a single data repository, creating so-called data lakes. The high volume and diversity of data in these repositories must be processed into standard formats that can be queried in real time. These data can then be used by sophisticated prediction algorithms currently under development, enabling the early recognition of patterns of clinical deterioration otherwise undetectable to humans. Improved predictions can reduce alarm fatigue. In addition, data are now automatically queriable on a real-time basis such that they can be fed back to clinicians in a time frame that allows for meaningful intervention. These advancements are key components of successful remote surveillance systems. Anesthesiologists have the opportunity to be at the forefront of remote surveillance in the care they provide in the operating room, postanesthesia care unit, and intensive care unit, while also expanding their scope to include high-risk preoperative and postoperative patients on the general care wards. These systems hold the promise of enabling anesthesiologists to detect and intervene upon changes in the clinical status of the patient before adverse events have occurred. Importantly, however, significant barriers still exist to the effective deployment of these technologies and their study in impacting patient outcomes. Studies demonstrating the impact of remote surveillance on patient outcomes are limited. Critical to the impact of the technology are strategies of implementation, including who should receive and respond to alerts and how they should respond. Moreover, the lack of cost-effectiveness data and the uncertainty of whether clinical activities surrounding these technologies will be financially reimbursed remain significant challenges to future scale and sustainability. This narrative review will discuss the evolving technical components of remote surveillance systems, the clinical use cases relevant to the anesthesiologist's practice, the existing evidence for their impact on patients, the barriers that exist to their effective implementation and study, and important considerations regarding sustainability and cost-effectiveness. © 2019 International Anesthesia Research Society.",,Anesthesiology; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Data Management; Humans; Medical Informatics; Quality of Health Care; Remote Sensing Technology; Time Factors; anesthesiologist; cost effectiveness analysis; electronic health record; human; intensive care unit; patient right; postoperative care; prediction; preoperative evaluation; priority journal; recovery room; Review; treatment outcome; ward; anesthesiology; cost benefit analysis; economics; health care quality; information processing; medical informatics; procedures; remote sensing; time factor,Lippincott Williams and Wilkins,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access

Since the introduction of this new type of information in EHRs is relatively new (for instance, the widespread adoption of EHRs in the United States is just about a decade old), it is not surprising that a myriad of approaches has been attempted, with various degrees of success. EHR systems undergo much customization to fit the needs of health systems; these approaches have been varied and not always generalizable. The intent of this article is to present a high-level view of these approaches, emphasizing the functionality that they are trying to achieve, and not to advocate for specific solutions, which may become obsolete soon after this review is published. We start by broadly defining the end goal of including genomics in EHRs for healthcare and then explaining the various sources of information that need to be linked to arrive at a clinically actionable genomics analysis using a pharmacogenomics example.

In clinical practice, the improved image quality should translate into more robust deep learning–based clinical diagnostics. Embedded deep learning will be enabled by the constantly improving hardware performance with low cost. We will briefly review possible computation methods in larger clinical systems. Briefly, they can be included in a three-layer framework composed of edge, fog, and cloud layers, the former being performed at a device level.

Although community pharmacists are highly accessible to patients and possess robust clinical knowledge, they are limited in the clinical services they can provide owing to their lack of access to patient health records. We proposed a blockchain- and AI-based conceptual framework by performing a scoping review of successful blockchain integration in health systems. Objective: To formulate a conceptual framework based on a scoping review to improve access to health care data in the community pharmacy setting through the adoption of blockchain technology and AI. Methods: We performed a scoping review of literature based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses review criteria to identify the specific areas where blockchain can be implemented in health systems. We utilized the Pharmacists’ Patient Care Process (PPCP) to identify 2 critical areas for blockchain integration that can support community pharmacists to access patient electronic health records and implement patient-specific information in clinical decision-making. Results: We included 7 articles out of 70 articles in our final review. The 2 areas in the PPCP identified for the use of blockchain on the basis of the literature review were “Assess” and “Implement.” Our proposed model involves pharmacists using AI and blockchain technology to comprehensively assess any concerns with the prescribed medication through access to laboratory results for patients and then implement a plan based on a comprehensive assessment of the patient's health record. Conclusions: Utilizing blockchain to securely share health data with community pharmacies has the potential to improve patient outcomes, optimize medication safety, and amplify pharmacists’ roles in patient care.

Furthermore, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches for supporting clinical research and support is increasing. However, AI and ML applications for precision dosing have been evaluated only recently. Given the capability of ML to handle multidimensional data, such as from electronic health records, opportunities for AI and ML applications to facilitate TDM and MIPD may be advantageous.Methods:This review summarizes relevant AI and ML approaches to support TDM and MIPD, with a specific focus on recent applications. The opportunities and challenges associated with this integration are also discussed.Results:Various AI and ML applications have been evaluated for precision dosing, including those related to concentration or exposure prediction, dose optimization, population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, quantitative systems pharmacology, and MIPD system development and support. These applications provide an opportunity for ML and pharmacometrics to operate in an integrated manner to provide clinical decision support for precision dosing.Conclusions:Although the integration of AI with precision dosing is still in its early stages and is evolving, AI and ML have the potential to work harmoniously and synergistically with pharmacometric approaches to support TDM and MIPD. Because data are increasingly shared between institutions and clinical networks and aggregated into large databases, these applications will continue to grow. The successful implementation of these approaches will depend on cross-field collaborations among clinicians and experts in informatics, ML, pharmacometrics, clinical pharmacology, and TDM. © The Author(s), 2022.

Improved visualization of patient information may help clinicians cope with information overload, increase efficiency, and improve quality. We compared the effect of information display interventions with usual care on patient care outcomes. Materials and Methods. We conducted a systematic review including experimental and quasi-experimental studies of information display interventions conducted in critical care and anesthesiology settings. Citations from January 1990 to June 2018 were searched in PubMed and IEEE Xplore. Reviewers worked independently to screen articles, evaluate quality, and abstract primary outcomes and display features. Results. Of 6742 studies identified, 22 studies evaluating 17 information displays met the study inclusion criteria. Information display categories included comprehensive integrated displays (3 displays), multipatient dashboards (7 displays), physiologic and laboratory monitoring (5 displays), and expert systems (2 displays). Significant improvement on primary outcomes over usual care was reported in 12 studies for 9 unique displays. Improvement was found mostly with comprehensive integrated displays (4 of 6 studies) and multipatient dashboards (5 of 7 studies). Only 1 of 5 randomized controlled trials had a positive effect in the primary outcome. Conclusion. We found weak evidence suggesting comprehensive integrated displays improve provider efficiency and process outcomes, and multipatient dashboards improve compliance with care protocols and patient outcomes. Randomized controlled trials of physiologic and laboratory monitoring displays did not show improvement in primary outcomes, despite positive results in simulated settings.

Several factors were related to implementation success, such as good leadership and management, infrastructure support, staff training and focus on workflows and usability. In general, EPR implementation is associated with improvements in documentation and screening performance and reduced prescribing errors, whereas there are minimal available data in other areas such as effects on clinical patient outcomes. The peer-reviewed literature appears to under-represent a range of technical factors important for EPR implementations, such as data migration from existing systems and impact of organisational readiness. Conclusion The findings presented here represent the synthesis of data from peer-reviewed literature in the field and should be of value to provide the evidencebase for organisations considering how best to implement an EPR system.

In 2016, the palliative care workforce has expanded markedly and there is growing appreciation of the benefits of palliative care, whether provided by a generalist (intensivist, nurse, social worker) or palliative care specialist. However, there is evidence that the quality of ICU-based palliative care is often suboptimal. A major barrier to more broadly addressing this quality problem is the lack of scalable ICU-based palliative care models that use technology to deliver efficient, collaborative palliative care in the ICU setting to the right patient at the right time. To address these challenges, we first review strengths and limitations of current care models as the basis for our novel conceptual framework that uses the electronic health record as a platform on which external innovations can be built, including: (1) screening for patients at risk for poor outcomes, (2) integrating patient- and family-reported needs, (3) personalizing care, and (4) directing generalist versus specialist triage algorithms. In the approaches considered, we describe current challenges and propose specific solutions that use technology to improve the quality of the human interaction in a stressful, complex environment. © 2016 by the American Thoracic Society.",Critical illness; Palliative care; Patient centeredness; Patient-reported outcomes,Algorithms; Biomedical Technology; Critical Illness; Electronic Health Records; Health Manpower; Intensive Care Units; Palliative Care; Patient-Centered Care; Prognosis; Triage; conceptual framework; critically ill patient; distress syndrome; electronic health record; emergency health service; family; health care quality; human; humanism; integrative medicine; intensive care unit; interpersonal communication; length of stay; medical specialist; medical technology; needs assessment; palliative therapy; patient care; patient risk; patient-reported outcome; priority journal; prognosis; quality of life; Review; screening; terminal care; algorithm; critical illness; electronic health record; health care manpower; intensive care unit; manpower; medical technology; organization and management; palliative therapy,American Thoracic Society,,,,Review,Final,

Data sharing in precision oncology is therefore of utmost importance. The Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) Data Principles have been developed to define good practices in data sharing. Motivated by the ambition of applying the FAIR Data Principles to our own clinical precision oncology implementations and research, we have performed a systematic literature review of potentially relevant initiatives. For clinical data, we suggest using the Genomic Data Commons model as a reference as it provides a field-tested and well-documented solution. Regarding classification of diagnosis, morphology and topography and drugs, we chose to follow the World Health Organization standards, i.e. ICD10, ICD-O-3 and Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classifications, respectively. For the bioinformatics pipeline, the Genome Analysis ToolKit Best Practices using Docker containers offer a coherent solution and have therefore been selected. Regarding the naming of variants, we follow the Human Genome Variation Society's standard. For the IT infrastructure, we have built a centralized solution to participate in data sharing through federated solutions such as the Beacon Networks. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

We conducted a scoping review to identify trends and gaps in the use of FHIR for clinical research. Materials and methods: We reviewed published literature, federally funded project databases, application websites, and other sources to discover FHIR-based papers, projects, and tools (collectively, ""FHIR projects"") available to support clinical research activities. Results: Our search identified 203 different FHIR projects applicable to clinical research. Most were associated with preparations to conduct research, such as data mapping to and from FHIR formats (n = 66, 32.5%) and managing ontologies with FHIR (n = 30, 14.8%), or post-study data activities, such as sharing data using repositories or registries (n = 24, 11.8%), general research data sharing (n = 23, 11.3%), and management of genomic data (n = 21, 10.3%). With the exception of phenotyping (n = 19, 9.4%), fewer FHIR-based projects focused on needs within the clinical research process itself. Discussion: Funding and usage of FHIR-enabled solutions for research are expanding, but most projects appear focused on establishing data pipelines and linking clinical systems such as electronic health records, patient-facing data systems, and registries, possibly due to the relative newness of FHIR and the incentives for FHIR integration in health information systems. Fewer FHIR projects were associated with research-only activities. Conclusion: The FHIR standard is becoming an essential component of the clinical research enterprise. To develop FHIR's full potential for clinical research, funding and operational stakeholders should address gaps in FHIR-based research tools and methods.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Digital patient-reported symptoms collected between visits can inform these, especially if integrated into electronic health records (EHRs) and clinical workflows. This systematic review identified and summarized EHR-integrated systems to remotely collect patient-reported symptoms and examined their anticipated and realized benefits in long-term conditions. Materials and Methods: We searched Medline, Web of Science, and Embase. Inclusion criteria were symptom reporting systems in adults with long-term conditions; data integrated into the EHR; data collection outside of clinic; data used in clinical care. We synthesized data thematically. Benefits were assessed against a list of outcome indicators. We critically appraised studies using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Results: We included 12 studies representing 10 systems. Seven were in oncology. Systems were technically and functionally heterogeneous, with the majority being fully integrated (data viewable in the EHR). Half of the systems enabled regular symptom tracking between visits. We identified 3 symptom report-guided clinical workflows: Consultation-only (data used during consultation, n = 5), alert-based (real-time alerts for providers, n = 4) and patient-initiated visits (n = 1). Few author-described anticipated benefits, primarily to improve communication and resultant health outcomes, were realized based on the study results, and were only supported by evidence from early-stage qualitative studies. Studies were primarily feasibility and pilot studies of acceptable quality. Discussion and Conclusions: EHR-integrated remote symptom monitoring is possible, but there are few published efforts to inform development of these systems. Currently there is limited evidence that this improves care and outcomes, warranting future robust, quantitative studies of efficacy and effectiveness.  © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

This use of artificial intelligence models in clinical decision support (AI-CDS) may have several advantages over traditional “rule-based” CDS models in pediatric care through increased model accuracy, with fewer false alerts and missed patients. AI-CDS tools must be appropriately developed, provide insight into the rationale behind decisions, be seamlessly integrated into care pathways, be intuitive to use, answer clinically relevant questions, respect the content expertise of the healthcare provider, and be scientifically sound. While numerous machine learning models have been reported in pediatric care, their integration into AI-CDS remains incompletely realized to date. Important challenges in the application of AI models in pediatric care include the relatively lower rates of clinically significant outcomes compared to adults, and the lack of sufficiently large datasets available necessary for the development of machine learning models. In this review article, we summarize key concepts related to AI-CDS, its current application to pediatric care, and its potential benefits and risks. Impact: The performance of clinical decision support may be enhanced by the utilization of machine learning-based algorithms to improve the predictive performance of underlying models.Artificial intelligence-based clinical decision support (AI-CDS) uses models that are experientially improved through training and are particularly well suited toward high-dimensional data.The application of AI-CDS toward pediatric care remains limited currently but represents an important area of future research. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to the International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.",,"Adult; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Child; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Humans; Machine Learning; Software; adult; algorithm; artificial intelligence; child; clinical decision support system; deterioration; health care personnel; human; machine learning; pediatrics; review; sound; algorithm; machine learning; software",Springer Nature,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access

Even with the increase in availability and use of mHealth apps, there has still not been a lot of research into understanding the intention to use this kind of apps. Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate a technology acceptance model (TAM) that has been specially designed for primary health care applications. Methods: The proposed model is an extension of the TAM, and was empirically tested using data obtained from a survey of mHealth app users (n=310). The research analyzed 2 additional external factors: promotion of health and health benefits. Data were analyzed with a PLS-SEM software and confirmed that gender moderates the adoption of mHealth apps in Spain. The explanatory capacity (R2 for behavioral intention to use) of the proposed model was 76.4%. Likewise, the relationships of the external constructs of the extended TAM were found to be significant. Results: The results show the importance of healthy habits developed by using mHealth apps. In addition, communication campaigns for these apps should be aimed at transferring the usefulness of eHealth as an agent for transforming attitudes; additionally, as more health benefits are obtained, ease of use becomes greater. Perceived usefulness (PU; ?=.415, t0.001;4999=3.442, P=.001), attitude toward using (?=.301, t0.01;499=2.299, P=.02), and promotion of health (?=.210, t0.05;499=2.108, P=.03) were found to have a statistically significant impact on behavior intention to use eHealth apps (R2=76.4%). Perceived ease of use (PEOU; ?=.179, t0.01;499=2.623, P=.009) and PU (?=.755, t0.001;499=12.888, P<.001) were found to have a statistically significant impact on attitude toward using (R2>=78.2%). Furthermore, PEOU (?=.203, t0.01;499=2.810, P=.005), health benefits (?=.448, t0.001;499=4.010, P<.001), and promotion of health (?=.281, t0.01;499=2.393, P=.01) exerted a significant impact on PU (R2=72.7%). Finally, health benefits (?=.640, t0.001;499=14.948, P<.001) had a statistically significant impact on PEOU (R2=40.9%), while promotion of health (?=.865, t0.001;499=29.943, P<.001) significantly influenced health benefits (R2=74.7%). Conclusions: mHealth apps could be used to predict the behavior of patients in the face of recommendations to prevent pandemics, such as COVID-19 or SARS, and to track users'symptoms while they stay at home. Gender is a determining factor that influences the intention to use mHealth apps, so perhaps different interfaces and utilities could be designed according to gender. © 2021 JMIR Publications.

However, currently, very few countries have systems that can implement digital interventions at scale. This is partly because of the lack of interoperable electronic health records (EHRs). It is difficult to make decisions for an individual or population when the data on that person or population are dispersed over multiple incompatible systems. This viewpoint paper has highlighted some key obstacles of current EHRs and some promising successes, with the goal of promoting EHR evolution and advocating for frameworks that develop digital health systems that serve populations-a critical goal as we move further into this data-rich century with an ever-increasing number of patients who live longer and depend on health care services where resources may already be strained. This paper aimed to analyze the evolution, obstacles, and current landscape of EHRs and identify fundamental areas of hindrance for interoperability. It also aimed to highlight countries where advances have been made and extract best practices from these examples. The obstacles to EHR interoperability are not easily solved, but improving the current situation in countries where a national policy is not in place will require a focused inquiry into solutions from various sources in the public and private sector. Effort must be made on a national scale to seek solutions for optimally interoperable EHRs beyond status quo solutions. A list of considerations for best practices is suggested. © 2021 JMIR Cancer.

The odds ratio for risk of developing disease with a positive FHH is frequently greater than 2, and actions can be taken to mitigate risk by adhering to screening guidelines, genetic counselling, genetic risk testing, and other screening methods. Challenges to the routine acquisition of FHH include constraints on provider time to collect data and the difficulty in accessing risk calculators. Disease-specific and broader risk assessment software platforms have been developed, many with clinical decision support and informatics interoperability, but few access patient information directly. Software that allows integration of FHH with the electronic medical record and clinical decision support capabilities has provided solutions to many of these challenges. Patient facing, electronic medical record, and web-enabled FHH platforms have been developed, and can provide greater identification of risk compared with conventional FHH ascertainment in primary care.

At the same time, new technologies and the electronic health record (EHR) in particular have permeated the oncology clinic. Initially designed as billing and clinical documentation systems, EHR systems have not anticipated the complexity and variety of genomic information that needs to be reviewed, interpreted, and acted upon on a daily basis. Improved integration of cancer genomic data with EHR systems will help guide clinician decision making, support secondary uses, and ultimately improve patient care within oncology clinics. Some of the key factors relating to the challenge of integrating cancer genomic data into EHRs include: the bioinformatics pipelines that translate raw genomic data into meaningful, actionable results; the role of human curation in the interpretation of variant calls; and the need for consistent standards with regard to genomic and clinical data. Several emerging paradigms for integration are discussed in this review, including: non-standardized efforts between individual institutions and genomic testing laboratories; ""middleware"" products that portray genomic information, albeit outside of the clinical workflow; and application programming interfaces that have the potential to work within clinical workflow.

Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms that learn how to accurately predict outcome variables using large sets of predictor variables that are typically not hand selected and are minimally curated. Models are parameterized using a training data set and then applied to a test data set on which predictive performance is evaluated. The application of ML algorithms to the problem of AMR has garnered increasing interest in the past 5 years due to the exponential growth of experimental and clinical data, heavy investment in computational capacity, improvements in algorithm performance, and increasing urgency for innovative approaches to reducing the burden of disease. Here, we review the current state of research at the intersection of ML and AMR with an emphasis on three domains of work. The first is the prediction of AMR using genomic data. The second is the use of ML to gain insight into the cellular functions disrupted by antibiotics, which forms the basis for understanding mechanisms of action and developing novel anti-infectives.

For proper and effective management of oral cancer, early diagnosis and accurate prediction of prognosis are important. To achieve this, artificial intelligence (AI) or its subfield, machine learning, has been touted for its potential to revolutionize cancer management through improved diagnostic precision and prediction of outcomes. Yet, to date, it has made only few contributions to actual medical practice or patient care. Objectives: This study provides a systematic review of diagnostic and prognostic application of machine learning in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and also highlights some of the limitations and concerns of clinicians towards the implementation of machine learning-based models for daily clinical practice. Data sources: We searched OvidMedline, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) databases from inception until February 2020 for articles that used machine learning for diagnostic or prognostic purposes of OSCC. Eligibility criteria: Only original studies that examined the application of machine learning models for prognostic and/or diagnostic purposes were considered. Data extraction: Independent extraction of articles was done by two researchers (A.R. & O.Y) using predefine study selection criteria. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) in the searching and screening processes. We also used Prediction model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) for assessing the risk of bias (ROB) and quality of included studies. Results: A total of 41 studies were published to have used machine learning to aid in the diagnosis/or prognosis of OSCC. The majority of these studies used the support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms as machine learning techniques. Their specificity ranged from 0.57 to 1.00, sensitivity from 0.70 to 1.00, and accuracy from 63.4 % to 100.0 % in these studies. The main limitations and concerns can be grouped as either the challenges inherent to the science of machine learning or relating to the clinical implementations. Conclusion: Machine learning models have been reported to show promising performances for diagnostic and prognostic analyses in studies of oral cancer. These models should be developed to further enhance explainability, interpretability, and externally validated for generalizability in order to be safely integrated into daily clinical practices. Also, regulatory frameworks for the adoption of these models in clinical practices are necessary. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Explainable AI; Machine learning; Oral squamous cell carcinoma; Systematic review,"Artificial Intelligence; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Machine Learning; Mouth Neoplasms; Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck; Diagnosis; Diseases; Extraction; Forecasting; Neural networks; Predictive analytics; Risk assessment; Search engines; Support vector machines; Effective management; Eligibility criterion; Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers; Machine learning models; Machine learning techniques; Oral squamous cell carcinomata; Prognostic analysis; Regulatory frameworks; accuracy; artificial neural network; autofluorescence; automation; Bayesian network; cancer diagnosis; cancer prognosis; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; clinical practice; confocal laser scanning microscopy; convolutional neural network; decision tree; deep neural network; disease specific survival; feature selection; fuzzy system; histopathology; human; immunohistochemistry; k nearest neighbor; lymph node metastasis; machine learning; mouth cancer; mouth squamous cell carcinoma; multilayer perceptron; overall survival; priority journal; random forest; relevance vector machine; Review; sensitivity and specificity; support vector machine; survival rate; systematic review; tongue carcinoma; artificial intelligence; head and neck tumor; machine learning; meta analysis; mouth tumor; squamous cell carcinoma; Learning systems",Elsevier B.V.,,,,Review,Final,

Although successful in promoting EHR adoption and use, the program, and other contributing factors, also produced important unintended consequences (UCs) with far-reaching implications for the US health system. Based on our own experiences from large health information technology (HIT) adoption projects and a collection of key studies in HIT evaluation, we discuss the most prominent UCs of MU: failed expectations, EHR market saturation, innovation vacuum, physician burnout, and data obfuscation. We identify challenges resulting from these UCs and provide recommendations for future research to empower the broader medical and informatics communities to realize the full potential of a now digitized health system. We believe that fixing these unanticipated effects will demand efforts from diverse players such as health care providers, administrators, HIT vendors, policy makers, informatics researchers, funding agencies, and outside developers; promotion of new business models; collaboration between academic medical centers and informatics research departments; and improved methods for evaluations of HIT. ©Tiago K Colicchio, James J Cimino, Guilherme Del Fiol.",Adoption; Meaningful use; Medical informatics applications,Electronic Health Records; Humans; Meaningful Use; Medical Informatics; United States; administrative personnel; adoption; burnout; funding; health care personnel; human; meaningful use criteria; medical informatics; review; scientist; university hospital; electronic health record; meaningful use criteria; medical informatics; procedures; United States,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

However, there remain challenges and issues to resolve in this domain owing to the lack of proper standards, the growth of new technologies (mobile devices, tablets, ubiquitous computing), and health care providers who are reluctant to share patient information. Therefore, a solid systematic literature review was performed to understand the use of this new technology in the health care sector. To the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of comprehensive systematic literature reviews that focus on Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR)-based electronic health records (EHRs). In addition, FHIR is the latest standard, which is in an infancy stage of development. Therefore, this is a hot research topic with great potential for further research in this domain. Objective: The main aim of this study was to explore and perform a systematic review of the literature related to FHIR, including the challenges, implementation, opportunities, and future FHIR applications. Methods: In January 2020, we searched articles published from January 2012 to December 2019 via all major digital databases in the field of computer science and health care, including ACM, IEEE Explorer, Springer, Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect. We identified 8181 scientific articles published in this field, 80 of which met our inclusion criteria for further consideration. Results: The selected 80 scientific articles were reviewed systematically, and we identified open questions, challenges, implementation models, used resources, beneficiary applications, data migration approaches, and goals of FHIR. Conclusions: The literature analysis performed in this systematic review highlights the important role of FHIR in the health care domain in the near future.  © Muhammad Ayaz, Muhammad F Pasha, Mohammed Y Alzahrani, Rahmat Budiarto, Deris Stiawan.",CDA Substitutable Medical Applications Reusable Technologies; Clinical document architecture; EHR; Electronic health record; Fast Health Interoperability Resources; FHIR; Health standard; HL7; SMART; Systematic literature review,,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

However, most of today’s medical data lack interoperability: hidden in isolated databases, incompatible systems and proprietary software, the data are difficult to exchange, analyze, and interpret. This slows down medical progress, as technologies that rely on these data – artificial intelligence, big data or mobile applications – cannot be used to their full potential. In this article, we argue that interoperability is a prerequisite for the digital innovations envisioned for future medicine. We focus on four areas where interoperable data and IT systems are particularly important: (1) artificial intelligence and big data; (2) medical communication; (3) research; and (4) international cooperation.

Apps specific to physical medicine and rehabilitation also are reviewed. These apps have the potential to provide low-cost, around-the-clock access to high-quality, evidence-based health information to end users on a global scale. However, they have not yet lived up to their potential due to multiple barriers, including lack of regulatory oversight, limited evidence-based literature, and concerns of privacy and security. The future directions may consist of improving data integration into the health care system, an interoperable app platform allowing access to electronic health record data, cloud-based personal health record across health care networks, and increasing app prescription by health care providers.

However, there has been a recent push towards patient-driven interoperability, in which health data exchange is patient-mediated and patient-driven. Patient-centered interoperability, however, brings with it new challenges and requirements around security and privacy, technology, incentives, and governance that must be addressed for this type of data sharing to succeed at scale. In this paper, we look at how blockchain technology might facilitate this transition through five mechanisms: (1) digital access rules, (2) data aggregation, (3) data liquidity, (4) patient identity, and (5) data immutability. We then look at barriers to blockchain-enabled patient-driven interoperability, specifically clinical data transaction volume, privacy and security, patient engagement, and incentives. We conclude by noting that while patient-driving interoperability is an exciting trend in healthcare, given these challenges, it remains to be seen whether blockchain can facilitate the transition from institution-centric to patient-centric data sharing. © 2018 The Authors",Application programming interface; Blockchain; Clinical data; Data exchange; Interoperability,Application programming interfaces (API); Blockchain; Data privacy; Health care; Interoperability; Applications programming interfaces; Block-chain; Business entities; Clinical data; Data Sharing; Digital access; Health data; Privacy technologies; Security and privacy; Security technology; blockchain technology; clinical study; data analysis; data interoperability; health care; health care access; health care cost; health care policy; human; medical informatics; medical information; medical information system; medical technology; patient care; patient identification; patient participation; priority journal; privacy; Review; transitional care; trend study; Electronic data interchange,Elsevier B.V.,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

However, there are currently limited examples of such techniques being successfully deployed into clinical practice. This article explores the main challenges and limitations of AI in healthcare, and considers the steps required to translate these potentially transformative technologies from research to clinical practice. Main body: Key challenges for the translation of AI systems in healthcare include those intrinsic to the science of machine learning, logistical difficulties in implementation, and consideration of the barriers to adoption as well as of the necessary sociocultural or pathway changes. Robust peer-reviewed clinical evaluation as part of randomised controlled trials should be viewed as the gold standard for evidence generation, but conducting these in practice may not always be appropriate or feasible. Performance metrics should aim to capture real clinical applicability and be understandable to intended users. Regulation that balances the pace of innovation with the potential for harm, alongside thoughtful post-market surveillance, is required to ensure that patients are not exposed to dangerous interventions nor deprived of access to beneficial innovations. Mechanisms to enable direct comparisons of AI systems must be developed, including the use of independent, local and representative test sets. Developers of AI algorithms must be vigilant to potential dangers, including dataset shift, accidental fitting of confounders, unintended discriminatory bias, the challenges of generalisation to new populations, and the unintended negative consequences of new algorithms on health outcomes. Conclusion: The safe and timely translation of AI research into clinically validated and appropriately regulated systems that can benefit everyone is challenging. Robust clinical evaluation, using metrics that are intuitive to clinicians and ideally go beyond measures of technical accuracy to include quality of care and patient outcomes, is essential. Further work is required (1) to identify themes of algorithmic bias and unfairness while developing mitigations to address these, (2) to reduce brittleness and improve generalisability, and (3) to develop methods for improved interpretability of machine learning predictions. If these goals can be achieved, the benefits for patients are likely to be transformational. © 2019 The Author(s).",Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Evaluation; Machine learning; Regulation; Translation,Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Peer Review; adoption; adult; algorithm; artificial intelligence; clinical evaluation; clinical practice; controlled study; gold standard; human; machine learning; postmarketing surveillance; prediction; randomized controlled trial (topic); review; health care delivery; peer review,BioMed Central Ltd.,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

Chemotherapy ordering is a high-risk task due to the complex nature of ordering workflows and potential detrimental effects if wrong chemotherapeutic doses are administered. Many chemotherapy ordering errors cannot be mitigated through systems-based changes due to the limited extent to which individual institutions are able to customize proprietary EHR software. We hypothesized that simulation-based training could improve providers’ ability to identify and mitigate common chemotherapy ordering errors. Methods: Pediatric hematology/oncology providers voluntarily participated in simulations using an EHR testing (“Playground”) environment. The number of safety risks identified and mitigated by each provider at baseline was recorded. Risks were reviewed one-on-one after initial simulations and at a group “lunch-and-learn” session. At three-month follow-up, repeat simulations assessed for improvements in error identification and mitigation, and providers were surveyed about prevention of real-life safety events. Results: The 8 participating providers identified and mitigated an average of 5.5 out of 10 safety risks during the initial simulation, compared 7.4 safety risks at the follow up simulation (p=0.030). Two of the providers (25%) reported preventing at least one real-world patient safety event in the clinical setting as a result of the initial training session. Conclusions: Simulation-based training may reduce providers’ susceptibility to chemotherapy ordering safety vulnerabilities within the EHR. This approach may be used when systems-based EHR improvements are not feasible due to limited ability to customize local instances of proprietary EHR software. © 2020 The Authors.

Food practice data collected in daily living settings can inform clinical decisions. However, integrating such data into clinical decision-making is burdensome for both clinicians and patients, resulting in poor adherence and limited utilization. Automation offers benefits in this regard, minimizing this burden resulting in a better fit with a patient's daily living routines, and creating opportunities for better integration into clinical workflow. Although the literature on patient-generated health data (PGHD) can serve as a starting point for the automation of food practice data, more diverse characteristics of food practice data provide additional challenges. Objectives We describe a series of steps for integrating food practices into clinical decision-making. These steps include the following: (1) sensing food practice; (2) capturing food practice data; (3) representing food practice; (4) reflecting the information to the patient; (5) incorporating data into the EHR; (6) presenting contextualized food practice information to clinicians; and (7) integrating food practice into clinical decision-making. Methods We elaborate on automation opportunities and challenges in each step, providing a summary visualization of the flow of food practice-related data from daily living settings to clinical settings. Results We propose four implications of automating food practice hereinafter. First, there are multiple ways of automating workflow related to food practice. Second, steps may occur in daily living and others in clinical settings. Food practice data and the necessary contextual information should be integrated into clinical decision-making to enable action. Third, as accuracy becomes important for food practice data, macrolevel data may have advantages over microlevel data in some situations. Fourth, relevant systems should be designed to eliminate disparities in leveraging food practice data. Conclusion Our work confirms previously developed recommendations in the context of PGHD work and provides additional specificity on how these recommendations apply to food practice. © 2022 American Institute of Physics Inc..

Materials and Methods: A qualitative study with interviews of DVs executives and decision-makers in data quality assessments (n = 12) and content analysis of interviews transcripts. Results: Data quality, from the perspective of DVs, is characterized by how it is defined, validated, and processed. DVs identify data quality as the main contributor to successful collaborations with life sciences/pharmaceutical research partners. Data quality feedback from clients provides the basis for DVs reviews and inspections of quality processes. DVs value customer interactions, view collaboration, shared common goals, mutual expertise, and communication related to data quality as success factors. Conclusion: Data quality evaluation practices are important. However, no uniform DVs industry standards for data quality assessment were identified. DVs describe their orientation to data quality evaluation as a direct result of not only the complex nature of data sources, but also of techniques, processes, and approaches used to construct data sets. Because real-world data (RWD), eg, patient data from electronic medical records, is used for real-world evidence (RWE) generation, the use of D/ALD will expand and require refinement. The focus on (and rigor in) data quality assessment (particularly in research necessary to make regulatory decisions) will require more structure, standards, and collaboration between DVs, life sciences/pharmaceutical, informaticists, and RWD/RWE policy-making stakeholders. © 2022 The Author(s).

The system provides cancer patients with coaching advice and supports their clinicians with suitable decisions based on clinical guidelines. Objectives As in many multi-agent systems we needed to coordinate the activities of all agents involved. Moreover, since the agents share a common blackboard where all patients' data are stored, we also needed to implement a mechanism for the prompt notification of each agent upon addition of new information potentially triggering its activation. Methods The communication needs have been investigated and modeled using the HL7-FHIR (Health Level 7-Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard to ensure proper semantic interoperability among agents. Then a syntax rooted in the FHIR search framework has been defined for representing the conditions to be monitored on the system blackboard for activating each agent. Results The Case Manager (CM) has been implemented as a dedicated component playing the role of an orchestrator directing the behavior of all agents involved. Agents dynamically inform the CM about the conditions to be monitored on the blackboard, using the syntax we developed. The CM then notifies each agent whenever any condition of interest occurs. The functionalities of the CM and other actors have been validated using simulated scenarios mimicking the ones that will be faced during pilot studies and in production. Conclusion The CM proved to be a key facilitator for properly achieving the required behavior of our multi-agent system. The proposed architecture may also be leveraged in many clinical contexts for integrating separate legacy services, turning them into a consistent telemedicine framework and enabling application reusability. © 2022 Georg Thieme Verlag.

We developed a tool called DDInteract to enhance and support shared decision-making (SDM) between patients and physicians when both warfarin and NSAIDs are used concurrently. DDInteract was designed to be integrated into electronic health records using interoperability standards. Objective: The purpose of this study was to conduct a formative evaluation of a DDInteract that incorporates patient and product contextual factors to estimate the risk of bleeding. Methods: A randomized formative evaluation was conducted to compare DDInteract to usual care (UC) using physician-patient dyads. Using case vignettes, physicians and patients on warfarin participated in simulated virtual clinical encounters where they discussed the use of taking ibuprofen and warfarin concurrently and determined an appropriate therapeutic plan based on the patient’s individualized risk. Dyads were randomized to either DDInteract or UC. Participants completed a postsession interview and survey of the SDM process. This included the 9-item Shared Decision-Making Questionnaire (SDM-Q-9), tool usability and workload National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Task Load Index, Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), Perceived Behavioral Control (PBC) scale, System Usability Scale (SUS), and Decision Conflict Scale (DCS). They also were interviewed after the session to obtain perceptions on DDInteract and UC resources for DDIs. Results: Twelve dyad encounters were performed using virtual software. Most (n=11, 91.7%) patients were over 50 years of age, and 9 (75%) had been taking warfarin for more than 2 years (75%). Regarding scores on the SDM-Q-9, participants rated DDInteract higher than UC for questions pertaining to helping patients clarify the decision (P=.03), involving patients in the decision (P=.01), displaying treatment options (P<.001), identifying advantages and disadvantages (P=.01), and facilitating patient understanding (P=.01) and discussion of preferences (P=.01). Five of the 8 UTAUT constructs showed differences between the 2 groups, favoring DDInteract (P<.05). Usability ratings from the SUS were significantly higher (P<.05) for physicians using DDInteract compared to those in the UC group but showed no differences from the patient’s perspective. No differences in patient responses were observed between groups using the DCS. During the session debrief, physicians indicated little concern for the additional time or workload entailed by DDInteract use. Both clinicians and patients indicated that the tool was beneficial in simulated encounters to understand and mitigate the risk of harm from this DDI. Conclusions: Overall, DDInteract may improve encounters where there is a risk of bleeding due to a potential drug-drug interaction involving anticoagulants. Participants rated DDInteract as logical and useful for enhancing SDM. They reported that they would be willing to use the tool for an interaction involving warfarin and NSAIDs. © Ainhoa Gomez Lumbreras, Thomas J Reese, Guilherme Del Fiol, Malinda S Tan, Jorie M Butler, Jason T Hurwitz, Mary Brown, Kensaku Kawamoto, Henrik Thiess, Maria Wright, Daniel C Malone.",anti-inflammatory; clinical; decision making; decision making; decision support; decision support systems; drug interaction; non-steroidal; NSAID; patient-centered care; pharmaceutical; pharmacotherapy; pharmacy; risk management; shared; unified theory of acceptance; use of technology; user-centered design; UTAUT; warfarin,,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

These proteins can be detected in healthy individuals at a lower level. This condition is called Monoclonal Gammopathy of Uncertain Significance (MGUS). MGUS is associated with a risk of progression toMMat a rate of 1-2% per year. Early diagnosis of MM correlates with improved overall survival for patients, so early referral of suspect cases is important. In collaboration with the Haematology experts at the University Hospital Limerick and the SCCE group in Computer Science, we designed and implemented a software application that improves and streamlines the current process. This (online) application is developed with modern XMDD technology, using the DIME low-code application development tool. The application faithfully maps the reference algorithm in an automated way and applies it to a consultation data set. The novelty consists in the adopted technologies, that improve the early validation and correctness of the software, and ease the human understanding and the modification turnaround of the application. © (2022).

In 2004, the National Institutes of Health endorsed the importance of PROs by initiating the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), which leverages computer-adaptive tests (CATs) to reduce patient burden while maintaining measurement precision. Historically, PROMIS CATs have been used in a large number of research studies outside the electronic health record (EHR), but growing demand for clinical use of PROs requires creative information technology solutions for integration into the EHR. Objectives This paper describes the introduction of PROMIS CATs into the Epic Systems EHR at a large academic medical center using a tight integration; we describe the process of creating a secure, automatic connection between the application programming interface (API) which scores and selects CAT items and Epic. Methods The overarching strategy was to make CATs appear indistinguishable from conventional measures to clinical users, patients, and the EHR software itself. We implemented CATs in Epic without compromising patient data security by creating custom middleware software within the organization's existing middleware framework. This software communicated between the Assessment Center API for item selection and scoring and Epic for item presentation and results. The middleware software seamlessly administered CATs alongside fixed-length, conventional PROs while maintaining the display characteristics and functions of other Epic measures, including automatic display of PROMIS scores in the patient's chart. Pilot implementation revealed differing workflows for clinicians using the software. Results The middleware software was adopted in 27 clinics across the hospital system. In the first 2 years of hospital-wide implementation, 793 providers collected 70,446 PROs from patients using this system. Conclusion This project demonstrated the importance of regular communication across interdisciplinary teams in the design and development of clinical software. It also demonstrated that implementation relies on buy-in from clinical partners as they integrate new tools into their existing clinical workflow. © 2023 Georg Thieme Verlag.

Methods: The Oklahoma cohort (n = 365) harnessed data elements from Passport for Care (PFC), and the Duke cohort (n = 274) employed informatics methods to automatically extract chemotherapy exposures from electronic health record (EHR) data for survivors 18 years old and younger at diagnosis. The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) late cardiovascular risk calculator was implemented, and risk groups for heart failure were compared to the Children's Oncology Group (COG) and the International Guidelines Harmonization Group (IGHG) recommendations. Analysis within the Oklahoma cohort assessed disparities in guideline-adherent care. Results: The Oklahoma and Duke cohorts both observed good overall concordance between the CCSS and COG risk groups for late heart failure, with weighted kappa statistics of.70 and.75, respectively. Low-risk groups showed excellent concordance (kappa >.9). Moderate and high-risk groups showed moderate concordance (kappa.44–.60). In the Oklahoma cohort, adolescents at diagnosis were significantly less likely to receive guideline-adherent echocardiogram surveillance compared with survivors younger than 13 years old at diagnosis (odds ratio [OD] 0.22; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.10–0.49). Conclusions: Clinical informatics tools represent a feasible approach to leverage discrete treatment-related data elements from PFC or the EHR to successfully implement previously validated late cardiovascular risk prediction models on a population health level. Concordance of CCSS, COG, and IGHG risk groups using real-world data informs current guidelines and identifies inequities in guideline-adherent care. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",cardio-oncology; clinical research informatics; late effects from childhood cancer; survivorship,anthracycline; daunorubicin; doxorubicin; epirubicin; idarubicin; mitoxantrone; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer radiotherapy; cancer registry; cardiovascular risk; childhood cancer survivor; cohort analysis; controlled study; echocardiography; electronic health record; heart failure; high risk population; human; low risk population; major clinical study; medical informatics; predictive model; protocol compliance; risk assessment; whole body radiation,John Wiley and Sons Inc,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access

Business analytics for radiation data can go from simple statistics to dynamic data analysis. It treats data visualization, analytics, and quality measurements. The complexity behind RDI analytics is not only about the technology used to create dashboards and compute quality measurements, but it is especially related to the complexity of collecting the data needed for the analytics tool. Most Dose Management Systems (DMS) are complex applications with many modules that provide multiple functionalities, like data collection, enhancement, and access. The central DMS module is the dose index tracker, which contains the data structure containing the radiation data collected from the different irradiating modalities from the various connected healthcare facilities. Most DMS modules are proprietary and connected to the dose index tracker without being independent of the vendor-specific dose database. Business analytics components in dose management systems have the same interoperability issue. Most of the radiation analytics tools and components have proprietary connectivity with a specific dose management system provider and cannot connect agnostically to different DMS providers.

However, the infusion rate entered into the infusion pump by the health care provider cannot be automatically reconciled with the injection order information entered into the electronic medical records (EMRs). This is because of the difficulty in linking the infusion rate entered into the infusion pump by the health care provider with the injection order information entered into the EMRs. Objectives This study investigated a data linkage method for reconciling infusion pump settings with injection orders in the EMRs. Methods We devised and implemented a mechanism to convert injection order information into the Health Level 7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), a new health information exchange standard, and match it with an infusion pump management system in a standard and simple manner using a REpresentational State Transfer (REST) application programming interface (API). The injection order information was extracted fromStandardized StructuredMedical Record Information Exchange version 2 International Organization for Standardization/technical specification 24289:2021 and was converted to the FHIR format using a commercially supplied FHIR conversion module and our own mapping definition. Data were also sent to the infusion pump management system using the REST Web API. Results Information necessary for injection implementation in hospital wards can be transferred to FHIR and linked. The infusion pump management system application screen allowed the confirmation that the two pieces of information matched, and it displayed an error message if they did not. Conclusion Using FHIR, the data linkage between EMRs and infusion pump management systems can be smoothly implemented. We plan to develop a new mechanism that contributes to medical safety through the actual implementation and verification of this matching system. © 2023 Georg Thieme Verlag.

Annual Symposium proceedings. AMIA Symposium,0.0,,"In December 2022, regulations from the U.S. Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT came into effect that require electronic health record (EHR) systems to accept the connection of any patient-facing digital health app using the SMART on FHIR standard. However, little has been reported with regard to architectural patterns that can be reused to take advantage of this industry development and integrate patient-facing apps into clinical workflows. To address this need, we propose SIMPLE, short for Standards-based Implementation Maximizing Portability Leveraging the EHR. The SIMPLE architectural pattern was designed to meet several key desiderata: do not require patients to install new software; do not retain patient data outside of the EHR; leverage EHRs' existing personal health record (PHR) capabilities to optimize user experience; and maximize portability. Using this pattern, an application for lung cancer screening known as MyLungHealth has been designed and is undergoing iterative user-centered enhancement. ©2023 AMIA - All rights reserved.",,Early Detection of Cancer; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Software; Workflow; early cancer diagnosis; electronic health record; human; lung tumor; software; workflow,,,,,Article,Final,

The questionnaire collected information regarding successfully completed order forms. First-year students were trained to perform phone calls and called their patients for five months. 205 patients then completed a post-intervention questionnaire. Dependent variables included completion rates for laboratory studies, specialty referrals, imaging studies and miscellaneous tests. Chi-squared tests were performed. Although the completion rates for laboratory testing (pre = 73.7% vs post = 81.1%), referrals (pre = 50.0% vs post = 65.1%) and imaging studies (pre = 60.9% vs post = 71.7%) increased, the results were not statistically significant. The completion rate of miscellaneous testing (pre = 41.7% vs post = 100.0%) increased following the implementation and was statistically significant. When patients were stratified to those who received a phone call, completion rates of referrals (73.0%), laboratory testing (86.1%), imaging studies (80.5%), and miscellaneous studies (100.0%) substantially increased. Although not statistically significant except for miscellaneous studies, there was an overall increase in completion in all categories. Further evidence to suggest that phone calls improved order completion was the substantial increase in completion rates in patients who received a call. The implementation improves completion of orders which could enhance preventive measures within the clinic. Additionally, it provides an opportunity for earlier student clinical exposure through direct patient contact. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Clinical education; Preventive medicine; Quality improvement; Student-run free clinic,"Ambulatory Care Facilities; Humans; Student Run Clinic; Students, Medical; Telephone; human; medical student; outpatient department; student-run clinic; telephone",Springer,,,,Article,Final,

This shift is with difficulties, though. The main challenges and possibilities related to integrating EHRs in pathology labs are described in this research. Concerns regarding data security and privacy, integrating EHRs with current systems, standardizing various data formats, user training, reluctance to change, and the high implementation costs are some of the difficulties. Robust security protocols, progressive integration techniques, standardizing data via commonly used coding schemes, thorough user training, and cautious budgetary planning are all necessary for finding solutions. For measuring, the research study used smart PLS software and generated results that included descriptive statistics, correlation coefficients and smart Algorithm models between them. Conversely, putting EHRs into practice presents chances for bettering patient interaction, interoperability, sophisticated data analytics, accessibility, and operational efficiency. These possibilities can completely change the way pathology labs operate, substituteing improved provider collaboration, more knowledgeable decision-making, and more patient empowerment. In conclusion, even if there are clear obstacles to overcome, there are a lot of potential advantages to using EHRs in pathology laboratories.

Methods: Risk for severe in-hospital outcomes was estimated using a validated ordinal logistic regression model to classify pneumonia severity. To render the results usable for ED clinicians, we created an integrated SMART on FHIR web application built for interoperable use in two pediatric EDs using different EHR vendors: Epic and Cerner. We followed a UCD framework, including problem analysis and user research, conceptual design and early prototyping, user interface development, formative evaluation, and post-deployment summative evaluation. Results: Problem analysis and user research from 39 clinicians and nurses revealed user preferences for risk aversion, accessibility, and timing of risk communication. Early prototyping and iterative design incorporated evidence-based design principles, including numeracy, risk framing, and best-practice visualization techniques. After rigorous unit and end-to-end testing, the application was successfully deployed in both EDs, which facilitatd enrollment, randomization, model visualization, data capture, and reporting for trial purposes. Conclusions: The successful implementation of a custom application for pneumonia prognosis and clinical trial support in two health systems on different EHRs demonstrates the importance of UCD, adherence to modern clinical data standards, and rigorous testing. Key lessons included the need for understanding users' real-world needs, regular knowledge management, application maintenance, and the recognition that FHIR applications require careful configuration for interoperability. © 2023 Georg Thieme Verlag.

The Portable Format for Biomedical data is based upon Avro and encapsulates a data model, a data dictionary, the data itself, and pointers to third party controlled vocabularies. In general, each data element in the data dictionary is associated with a third party controlled vocabulary to make it easier for applications to harmonize two or more PFB files. We also introduce an open source software development kit (SDK) called PyPFB for creating, exploring and modifying PFB files. We describe experimental studies showing the performance improvements when importing and exporting bulk biomedical data in the PFB format versus using JSON and SQL formats.

Clinical decision support systems have not been extensively investigated in cirrhosis management. Human-centered design (HCD) is an approach that engages with potential users in intervention development. In this study, we applied HCD to design the features and interface for a clinical decision support system for cirrhosis management, called CirrhosisRx. Methods: We conducted technical feasibility assessments to construct a visual blueprint that outlines the basic features of the interface. We then convened collaborative-design workshops with generalist and specialist clinicians. We elicited current workflows for cirrhosis management, assessed gaps in existing EHR systems, evaluated potential features, and refined the design prototype for CirrhosisRx. At the conclusion of each workshop, we analyzed recordings and transcripts. Results: Workshop feedback showed that the aggregation of relevant clinical data into 6 cirrhosis decompensation domains (defined as common inpatient clinical scenarios) was the most important feature. Automatic inference of clinical events from EHR data, such as gastrointestinal bleeding from hemoglobin changes, was not accepted due to accuracy concerns. Visualizations for risk stratification scores were deemed not necessary. Lastly, the HCD co-design workshops allowed us to identify the target user population (generalists). Conclusions: This is one of the first applications of HCD to design the features and interface for an electronic intervention for cirrhosis management. The HCD process altered features, modified the design interface, and likely improved CirrhosisRx’s overall usability. The finalized design for CirrhosisRx proceeded to development and production and will be tested for effectiveness in a pragmatic randomized controlled trial. This work provides a model for the creation of other EHR-based interventions in hepatology care.

To address this limitation, we evaluated the feasibility of extracting treatment data directly from EHRs using the REDCap Clinical Data Interoperability Services (CDIS) module for future submission to the INRGdc.METHODSPatients enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group neuroblastoma biology study ANBL00B1 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00904241) who received care at the University of Chicago (UChicago) or the Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) after the go-live dates for the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)-compliant EHRs were identified. Antineoplastic drug orders were extracted using the CDIS module. To validate the CDIS output, antineoplastic agents extracted through FHIR were compared with those queried through EHR relational databases (UChicago's Clinical Research Data Warehouse and VUMC's Epic Clarity database) and manual chart review.RESULTSThe analytic cohort consisted of 41 patients at UChicago and 32 VUMC patients. Antineoplastic drug orders were identified in the extracted EHR records of 39 (95.1%) UChicago patients and 26 (81.3%) VUMC patients. Manual chart review confirmed that patients with missing (n = 8) or discontinued (n = 1) orders in the CDIS output did not receive antineoplastic agents during the timeframe of the study. More than 99% of the antineoplastic drug orders in the EHR relational databases were identified in the corresponding CDIS output.CONCLUSIONOur results demonstrate the feasibility of extracting EHR treatment data with high fidelity using HL7-FHIR via REDCap CDIS for future submission to the INRGdc.  © 2024 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",,"Antineoplastic Agents; Child; Child, Preschool; Databases, Factual; Electronic Health Records; Female; Health Information Interoperability; Humans; Infant; Male; Neuroblastoma; (3 iodobenzyl)guanidine; aldesleukin; busulfan; carboplatin; cisplatin; cyclophosphamide; dinutuximab; doxorubicin; etoposide; irinotecan; isotretinoin; melphalan; sargramostim; temozolomide; thiotepa; topotecan; vincristine; antineoplastic agent; adult; Article; cancer patient; cancer risk; cancer surgery; Clinical Data Interoperability Services Module; clinical study; cohort analysis; comparative study; consolidation chemotherapy; controlled study; data extraction; electronic health record; Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources; feasibility study; female; human; induction chemotherapy; informatics standard; major clinical study; male; medical record review; multicenter study; multiple cycle treatment; neuroblastoma; treatment response; child; data interoperability; drug therapy; factual database; infant; neuroblastoma; preschool child; therapy",Lippincott Williams and Wilkins,,,,Article,Final,

Most HA-VTE, including fatal pulmonary emboli, occur among medically ill patients. The rate of symptomatic VTE more than doubles over the first 21 days after hospital discharge. Trials have demonstrated that the burden of HA-VTE may be reduced with postdischarge thromboprophylaxis; however, few patients receive this therapy. We formerly validated the ability of eVTE (eVTE is the abbreviation for a risk assessment tool constituted by 2 calculations: one predicts 90-day VTE and the other predicts 30-day major bleeding derived from only elements of the complete blood count and basic metabolic panel and age) to identify medical patients being discharged with both an elevated risk of VTE and a low risk of bleeding. Objectives: Implement a cluster-randomized, stepped wedge, type II hybrid implementation/effectiveness trial generating an alert among select at-risk patients upon discharge for implementation of thrombosis chemoprophylaxis in a 23-hospital not-for-profit healthcare system. Methods: We use the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance framework to guide implementation and outcomes reporting. Results: The primary outcome for aim 1 (implementation) is the prescription of rivaroxaban 10 mg daily for 30 days as postdischarge thromboprophylaxis among at-risk patients. The primary efficacy and safety outcomes (effectiveness) are the 90-day composite of symptomatic VTE, myocardial infartcion, nonhemorrhagic stroke, all-cause mortality, and 30-day major bleeding. Conclusion: The eVTE trial will provide high-quality, real-world evidence on the effectiveness and safety of a pragmatic intervention to implement targeted postdischarge thromboprophylaxis using decision support embedded in the electronic health record. © 2024 The Author(s)",extended-duration thromboprophylaxis; medical patients; prophylaxis; risk score; thrombosis; venous thromboembolism,rivaroxaban; all cause mortality; Article; atherosclerosis; behavior change; blood cell count; cerebrovascular accident; chemoprophylaxis; clinical outcome; coronary artery disease; drug efficacy; drug safety; female; health care system; heart infarction; hospital discharge; hospital readmission; hospitalization; human; lung embolism; major bleeding; outcome assessment; prospective study; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis; thrombosis prevention; venous thromboembolism,Elsevier B.V.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

The continuous rise of new and diversified technology to obtain and handle health data places health information management and governance under pressure. Lack of data linkage and interoperability between systems undermines best efforts to optimise integrated health information technology solutions. Objective: This research aimed to provide a bibliometric overview of the role of interoperability and linkage in health data management and governance. Method: Data were acquired by entering selected search queries into Google Scholar, PubMed, and Web of Science databases and bibliometric data obtained were then imported to Endnote and checked for duplicates. The refined data were exported to Excel, where several levels of filtration were applied to obtain the final sample. These sample data were analysed using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Washington, USA), WORDSTAT (Provalis Research, Montreal, Canada) and VOSviewer software (Leiden University, Leiden, Netherlands). Results: The literature sample was retrieved from 3799 unique results and consisted of 63 articles, present in 45 different publications, both evaluated by two specific in-house global impact rankings. Through VOSviewer, three main clusters were identified: (i) e-health information stakeholder needs; (ii) e-health information quality assessment; and (iii) e-health information technological governance trends. A residual correlation between interoperability and linkage studies in the sample was also found. Conclusion: Assessing stakeholders’ needs is crucial for establishing an efficient and effective health information system. Further and diversified research is needed to assess the integrated placement of interoperability and linkage in health information management and governance. Implications: This research has provided valuable managerial and theoretical contributions to optimise system interoperability and data linkage within health information research and information technology solutions. © The Author(s) 2024.",bibliometrics; blockchain in healthcare; data linkage; e-health; health information exchange; health information governance; health information interoperability; health information management; health information systems; healthcare stakeholders; information storage and retrieval; medical informatics; system interoperability,,SAGE Publications Inc.,,,,Article,Article in press,

However, integrating them into health information systems (HISs) introduces challenges beyond clinical decision making, such as interoperability and diverse electronic health records (EHR) formats. We proposed Model Cabinet Architecture (MoCab), a framework designed to leverage fast healthcare interoperability resources (FHIR) as the standard for data storage and retrieval when deploying machine learning models across various HISs, addressing the challenges highlighted by platforms such as EPOCH®, ePRISM®, KETOS, and others. Methods: The MoCab architecture is designed to streamline predictive modeling in healthcare through a structured framework incorporating several specialized parts. The Data Service Center manages patient data retrieval from FHIR servers. These data are then processed by the Knowledge Model Center, where they are formatted and fed into predictive models. The Model Retraining Center is crucial in continuously updating these models to maintain accuracy in dynamic clinical environments. The framework further incorporates Clinical Decision Support (CDS) Hooks for issuing clinical alerts. It uses Substitutable Medical Apps Reusable Technologies (SMART) on FHIR to develop applications for displaying alerts, prediction results, and patient records. Results: The MoCab framework was demonstrated using three types of predictive models: a scoring model (qCSI), a machine learning model (NSTI), and a deep learning model (SPC), applied to synthetic data that mimic a major EHR system. The implementations showed how MoCab integrates predictive models with health data for clinical decision support, utilizing CDS Hooks and SMART on FHIR for seamless HIS integration. The demonstration confirmed the practical utility of MoCab in supporting clinical decision making, validated by its application in various healthcare settings. Conclusions: We demonstrate MoCab's potential in promoting the interoperability of machine learning models and enhancing its utility across various EHRs. Despite facing challenges like FHIR adoption, MoCab addresses key challenges in adapting machine learning models within healthcare settings, paving the way for further enhancements and broader adoption. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Clinical decision support; Fast healthcare interoperability resources (FHIR); Machine learning; SMART on FHIR,"Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Electronic Health Records; Health Information Interoperability; Health Information Systems; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Machine Learning; Computer software reusability; Decision making; Decision support systems; Deep learning; Digital storage; Health care; Hospital data processing; Information systems; Information use; Learning systems; Clinical decision support; Fast healthcare interoperability resource; Health information systems; Healthcare Interoperability; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Predictive models; Reusable technology; Substitutable medical app reusable technology on fast healthcare interoperability resource; article; clinical decision making; clinical decision support system; deep learning; diagnosis; electronic health record; Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources; human; information retrieval; information storage; machine learning; major clinical study; medical information system; medical record; medical service; patient coding; prediction; predictive model; quick COVID-19 severity index; data interoperability; electronic health record; medical information system; procedures; Interoperability",Elsevier Ireland Ltd,,,,Article,Final,

Advanced language models, such as large language models (LLMs), may help overcome current challenges in information exchange. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the capability of LLMs in transforming and transferring health care data to support interoperability. Methods: Using data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III and UK Biobank, the study conducted 3 experiments. Experiment 1 assessed the accuracy of transforming structured laboratory results into unstructured format. Experiment 2 explored the conversion of diagnostic codes between the coding frameworks of the ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification), and Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT) using a traditional mapping table and a text-based approach facilitated by the LLM ChatGPT. Experiment 3 focused on extracting targeted information from unstructured records that included comprehensive clinical information (discharge notes). Results: The text-based approach showed a high conversion accuracy in transforming laboratory results (experiment 1) and an enhanced consistency in diagnostic code conversion, particularly for frequently used diagnostic names, compared with the traditional mapping approach (experiment 2). In experiment 3, the LLM showed a positive predictive value of 87.2% in extracting generic drug names. Conclusions: This study highlighted the potential role of LLMs in significantly improving health care data interoperability, demonstrated by their high accuracy and efficiency in data transformation and exchange. The LLMs hold vast potential for enhancing medical data exchange without complex standardization for medical terms and data structure. ©Dukyong Yoon, Changho Han, Dong Won Kim, Songsoo Kim, SungA Bae, Jee An Ryu, Yujin Choi.",data standardization; health care interoperability; large language models; medical data transformation; text-based,Electronic Health Records; Health Information Exchange; Health Information Interoperability; Humans; Natural Language Processing; Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine; alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; bilirubin; creatinine; gamma glutamyltransferase; generic drug; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein; low density lipoprotein; metoprolol tartrate; paracetamol; triacylglycerol; adult; Article; ChatGPT; female; health data; hospital discharge; human; ICD-9-CM; major clinical study; male; malignant pleura effusion; medical documentation; medical information; medical record; middle aged; platelet count; predictive value; prescription; Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine; data interoperability; electronic health record; medical information system; natural language processing,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

The objective of this study was to determine factors associated with meaningful treatment escalation (MTE) of psoriasis as a pilot study for future real-world HSR studies. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, observational cohort study of psoriasis patients by using data collected during routine clinical care from an EHR using EpiCare® SmartForms. The psoriasis SmartForm records psoriasis disease severity measures and descriptive findings to generate visit notes. These data were extracted and analyzed to identify factors associated with MTE, defined as changing or adding, phototherapy, systemic, or biologic therapy. Results: 473 psoriasis patients met study criteria; 239 underwent MTE between their first and third observed visits. Patients who experienced MTE had more severe disease at Visit 1—assessed by BSA, pPGA, oPGA, and a patient-reported disease severity measure--than patients who did not experience MTE. Other factors associated with MTE included use of topicals only or no active treatment at Visit 1, palmoplantar disease, and involvement of other difficult-to-treat body areas. Patients who underwent MTE experienced larger improvements in disease severity than those who did not. Conclusions: This study highlights how data collected during routine clinical practice can be readily used for real-world retrospective HSR when disease measures are captured as discrete elements. This approach could provide a cost-effective platform to conduct real-world HSR. © The Author(s) 2023.",comparative effectiveness; electronic health records; pragmatic studies; psoriasis; retrospective cohort; SmartForms,acitretin; calcineurin inhibitor; corticosteroid; cyclosporine; methotrexate; psoralen; retinoid; vitamin D derivative; adult; Article; biological therapy; clinical feature; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; demographics; depression; disease severity; electronic health record; female; human; hyperlipidemia; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nail disease; obesity; observational study; phototherapy; pilot study; prescribing practice; psoriasis; psoriasis vulgaris; retrospective study; systemic therapy; therapy escalation,SAGE Publications Ltd,,,,Article,Final,

The lack of integration of PGx into existing CDS may result in incomplete interaction information, which may pose patient safety concerns. We sought to develop a cloud-based orchestrated medication CDS service that integrates PGx with a broad set of drug screening alerts and evaluate it through a clinician utility study. Methods We developed the PillHarmonics service for implementation per the CDS Hooks protocol, algorithmically integrating a wide range of drug interaction knowledge using cloud-based screening services from First Databank (drug-drug/allergy/condition), PharmGKB (drug-gene), and locally curated content (drug-renal/hepatic/race). We performed a user study, presenting 13 clinicians and pharmacists with a prototype of the system's usage in synthetic patient scenarios. We collected feedback via a standard questionnaire and structured interview. Results Clinician assessment of PillHarmonics via the Technology Acceptance Model questionnaire shows significant evidence of perceived utility. Thematic analysis of structured interviews revealed that aggregated knowledge, concise actionable summaries, and information accessibility were highly valued, and that clinicians would use the service in their practice. Conclusion Medication safety and optimizing efficacy of therapy regimens remain significant issues. A comprehensive medication CDS system that leverages patient clinical and genomic data to perform a wide range of interaction checking and presents a concise and holistic view of medication knowledge back to the clinician is feasible and perceived as highly valuable for more informed decision-making. Such a system can potentially address many of the challenges identified with current medication-related CDS. © 2024 Georg Thieme Verlag.

Objectives: This study aimed to develop predictive models of childhood obesity, applying advanced machine learning methods to a large unaugmented electronic health record (EHR) dataset. This work improves on other studies that have (i) relied on data not routinely available in EHRs (like prenatal data), (ii) focused on single-age predictions, or (iii) not been rigorously validated. Methods: A customized sequential deep-learning model to predict the development of obesity was built, using EHR data from 36,191 diverse children aged 0–10 years. The model was evaluated using extensive discrimination, calibration, and utility analysis; and was validated temporally, geographically, and across various subgroups. Results: Our results are mostly better or comparable to similar studies. Specifically, the model achieved an AUROC above 0.8 in all cases (with most cases around 0.9) for predicting obesity within the next 3 years for children 2–7 years of age. Validation results show the model's robustness and top predictors match important risk factors of obesity. Conclusions: Our model can predict the risk of obesity for young children at multiple time points using only routinely collected EHR data, greatly facilitating its integration into clinical care. Our model can be used as an objective screening tool to provide clinicians with insights into a patient's risk for developing obesity so that early lifestyle counseling can be provided to prevent future obesity in young children. © 2024 The Author(s)",Childhood obesity; Deep learning; Electronic health records,,Elsevier B.V.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

The LIS automates processes, manages results, and interfaces with healthcare information sources. Challenges include workflow inefficiencies and data interpretation issues. Despite increased data accessibility, managing clinical data across systems remains complex. Integrating laboratory machines into LIS is essential for optimizing healthcare delivery, requiring effective integration technologies. This study aims to synthesize the existing empirical studies on the utilization of integration technologies for Software-to-Software (S2S) communication in automating clinical laboratory processes. This study systematically examined integration technologies in LIS using PubMed and following PRISMA 2020 guidelines. The three-phase methodology included a scoping analysis, methodological analysis, and a gap analysis, focusing on S2S communication, interoperability frameworks, data standards, communication protocols, and challenges in LIS integration technologies. Analysis of 28 sample studies revealed a complex landscape in LIS integration shaped by end-users, care providers, and researchers. Clinical laboratories prioritize integration, focusing on patient data and sustainability. Standards like HL7 and FHIR ensure interoperability. Eleven methodologies highlight system development in Health Information Systems (HIS). Interoperability is a common objective, with 22 out of 28 studies achieving success. Challenges include limited generalizability, poor validation, and post-implementation modifications.

In this study, the authors present three smart interventions for patients: (a) mobile reminders, (b) electronic monitoring, and (c) composite intervention. More specifically, the authors present a design approach for smart interventions and operationalize the interventions. They have developed an analytical model for evaluating interventions. Interventions are cost-effective for higher values of intervention effectiveness, hospital, and emergency room cost. However, with quality-of-life (QoL) improvement, cost-effectiveness improves significantly. The authors also explored the use of financial incentives for increasing the adoption of interventions. These results will help patients, healthcare professionals, decision-makers, and family members to choose the most suitable intervention to address opioid abuse. © 2024 IGI Global.

The aim of this study was to develop a prediction model for identifying patients at high risk of inadequate bowel preparation for potential clinical integration into the electronic medical record (EMR). Methods: A retrospective study was conducted using outpatient screening/surveillance colonoscopies at the University of North Carolina from 2017 to 2022. Data were extracted from the EMRs of Epic and ProVation, including demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical variables. Logistic regression, LASSO regression, and gradient boosting machine models were evaluated and validated in a held-out testing set. Results: The dataset included 23,456 colonoscopies, of which 6.25% had inadequate bowel preparation. The reduced LASSO regression model demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.65 (95% CI 0.63-0.67) in the held-out testing set. The relative risk of inadequate bowel prep in the high-risk group determined by the model was 2.42 (95% CI 2.07-2.82) compared with patients identified as low risk. The model calibration in the testing set revealed that among patients categorized as having 0%-11%, 11%-22%, and 22%-33% predicted risk of inadequate prep, the respective proportions of patients with inadequate prep were 5.5%, 19.3%, and 33.3%. Using the reduced LASSO model, a rudimentary code for a potential Epic FHIR application called PrepPredict was developed. Conclusion: This study developed a prediction model for inadequate bowel preparation with the potential to integrate into the EMR for clinical use and optimize bowel preparation to improve patient care. © 2024",Bowel preparation; Electronic medical record; Machine learning; Risk prediction,antidepressant agent; antidiabetic agent; benzodiazepine derivative; insulin; neuroleptic agent; opiate; adult; area under the curve; Article; colonoscopy; controlled study; electronic medical record; female; human; intestine preparation; major clinical study; male; middle aged; North Carolina; outpatient; patient care; retrospective study,Elsevier B.V.,,,,Article,Final,
211,Shahzad A.; Chen W.; Shaheen M.; Zhang Y.; Ahmad F.,A robust algorithm for authenticated health data access via blockchain and cloud computing,2024,PLoS ONE,0.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0307039,"In modern healthcare, providers increasingly use cloud services to store and share electronic medical records. However, traditional cloud hosting, which depends on intermediaries, poses risks to privacy and security, including inadequate control over access, data auditing, and tracking data origins. Additionally, current schemes face significant limitations such as scalability concerns, high computational overhead, practical implementation challenges, and issues with interoperability and data standardization. Unauthorized data access by cloud providers further exacerbates these concerns. Blockchain technology, known for its secure and decentralized nature, offers a solution by enabling secure data auditing in sharing systems. This research integrates blockchain into healthcare for efficient record management. We proposed a blockchain-based method for secure EHR management and integrated Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) for fine-grained access control. The proposed algorithm combines blockchain and smart contracts with a cloud-based healthcare Service Management System (SMS) to ensure secure and accessible EHRs. Smart contracts automate key management, encryption, and decryption processes, enhancing data security and integrity. The blockchain ledger authenticates data transactions, while the cloud provides scalability. The SMS manages access requests, enhancing resource allocation and response times. A dual authentication system confirms patient keys before granting data access, with failed attempts leading to access revocation and incident logging. Our analyses show that this algorithm significantly improves the security and efficiency of health data exchanges. By combining blockchain’s decentralized structure with the cloud’s scalability, this approach significantly improves EHR security protocols in modern healthcare setting. © 2024 Shahzad et al.

However, a gap exists in capturing knowledge representation to classify, quantify, qualify, and codify the intersection of evidence and quality improvement (QI) implementation. This interprofessional case report leverages a novel semantic and ontological approach to bridge this gap. Objectives  This report had two objectives. First, it aimed to synthesize implementation barrier and facilitator data from employee wellness QI initiatives across Veteran Affairs health care systems through a semantic and ontological approach. Second, it introduced an original framework of this use-case-based taxonomy on implementation barriers and facilitators within a QI process. Methods  We synthesized terms from combined datasets of all-site implementation barriers and facilitators through QI cause-and-effect analysis and qualitative thematic analysis. We developed the Quality Improvement and Implementation Taxonomy (QIIT) classification scheme to categorize synthesized terms and structure. This framework employed a semantic and ontological approach. It was built upon existing terms and models from the QI Plan, Do, Study, Act phases, the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research domains, and the fishbone cause-and-effect categories. Results  The QIIT followed a hierarchical and relational classification scheme. Its taxonomy was linked to four QI Phases, five Implementing Domains, and six Conceptual Determinants modified by customizable Descriptors and Binary or Likert Attribute Scales. Conclusion  This case report introduces a novel approach to standardize the process and taxonomy to describe evidence translation to QI implementation barriers and facilitators. This classification scheme reduces redundancy and allows semantic agreements on concepts and ontological knowledge representation. Integrating existing taxonomies and models enhances the efficiency of reusing well-developed taxonomies and relationship modeling among constructs. Ultimately, employing STs helps generate comparable and sharable QI evaluations for forecast, leading to sustainable implementation with clinically informed innovative solutions. © 2023 Georg Thieme Verlag.

Medical decision-making under uncertainty is susceptible to cognitive biases which can lead to systematic errors of reasoning and suboptimal patient care. Here we review common cognitive biases that may be relevant for transfusion practice. Materials and Methods: Biases were selected based on categorical diversity, evidence from healthcare contexts, and relevance for transfusion medicine. For each bias, we provide background psychology literature, representative clinical examples, considerations for transfusion medicine, and strategies for mitigation. Results: We report seven cognitive biases relating to memory (availability heuristic, limited memory), interpretation (framing effects, anchoring bias), and incentives (search satisficing, sunk cost fallacy, feedback sanction). Conclusion: Pitfalls of reasoning due to cognitive biases are prominent in medical decision making and relevant for hospital transfusion medicine. An awareness of these phenomena might stimulate further research, encourage corrective measures, and motivate nudge-based interventions to improve transfusion practice. © 2024 The Author(s).

Unfortunately, adherence to the published best practices for VTE prevention, based on patient centered outcomes research (PCOR), is highly variable across U.S. hospitals, which represents a gap between current evidence and clinical practice leading to adverse patient outcomes. This gap is especially large in the case of traumatic brain injury (TBI), where reluctance to initiate VTE prevention due to concerns for potentially increasing the rates of intracranial bleeding drives poor rates of VTE prophylaxis. This is despite research which has shown early initiation of VTE prophylaxis to be safe in TBI without increased risk of delayed neurosurgical intervention or death. Clinical decision support (CDS) is an indispensable solution to close this practice gap; however, design and implementation barriers hinder CDS adoption and successful scaling across health systems. Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) informed by PCOR evidence can be deployed using CDS systems to improve the evidence to practice gap. In the Scaling AcceptabLE cDs (SCALED) study, we will implement a VTE prevention CPG within an interoperable CDS system and evaluate both CPG effectiveness (improved clinical outcomes) and CDS implementation. Methods: The SCALED trial is a hybrid type 2 randomized stepped wedge effectiveness-implementation trial to scale the CDS across 4 heterogeneous healthcare systems. Trial outcomes will be assessed using the RE2-AIM planning and evaluation framework. Efforts will be made to ensure implementation consistency. Nonetheless, it is expected that CDS adoption will vary across each site. To assess these differences, we will evaluate implementation processes across trial sites using the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment (EPIS) implementation framework (a determinant framework) using mixed-methods. Finally, it is critical that PCOR CPGs are maintained as evidence evolves. To date, an accepted process for evidence maintenance does not exist. We will pilot a “Living Guideline” process model for the VTE prevention CDS system. Discussion: The stepped wedge hybrid type 2 trial will provide evidence regarding the effectiveness of CDS based on the Berne-Norwood criteria for VTE prevention in patients with TBI. Additionally, it will provide evidence regarding a successful strategy to scale interoperable CDS systems across U.S. healthcare systems, advancing both the fields of implementation science and health informatics.

215,Kirilov N.,Capture of real-time data from electronic health records: scenarios and solutions,2024,mHealth,0.0,10.21037/mhealth-24-2,"Background: The integration of real-time data (RTD) in the electronic health records (EHRs) is transforming the healthcare of tomorrow. In this work, the common scenarios of capturing RTD in the healthcare from EHRs are studied and the approaches and tools to implement real-time solutions are investigated. Methods: Delivering RTD by representational state transfer (REST) application programming interfaces (APIs) is usually accomplished through a Publish-Subscribe approach. Common technologies and protocols used for implementing subscriptions are REST hooks and WebSockets. Polling is a straightforward mechanism for obtaining updates; nevertheless, it may not be the most efficient or scalable solution. In such cases, other approaches are often preferred. Database triggers and reverse proxies can be useful in RTD scenarios; however, they should be designed carefully to avoid performance bottlenecks and potential issues. Results: The implementation of subscriptions through REST hooks and WebSocket notifications using a Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) REST API, as well as the design of a reverse proxy and database triggers is described. Reference implementations of the solutions are provided in a GitHub repository. For the reverse proxy implementation, the Go language (Golang) was used, which is specialized for the development of server-side networking applications. For FHIR servers a python script is provided to create a sample Subscription resource to send RTD when a new Observation resource for specific patient id is created. The sample WebSocket client is written using the “websocket-client” python library. The sample RTD endpoint is created using the “Flask” framework. For database triggers a sample structured query language (SQL) query for Postgres to create a trigger when an INSERT or UPDATE operation is executed on the FHIR resource table is available. Furthermore, a use case clinical example, where the main actors are the healthcare providers (hospitals, physician private practices, general practitioners and medical laboratories), health information networks and the patient are drawn. The RTD flow and exchange is shown in detail and how it could improve healthcare. Conclusions: Capturing RTD is undoubtedly vital for health professionals and successful digital healthcare. The topic remains unexplored especially in the context of EHRs. In our work for the first time the common scenarios and problems are investigated. Furthermore, solutions and reference implementations are provided which could support and contribute to the development of real-time applications. © mHealth.

That data are often not readily accessible for such secondary use within CIS databases, particularly for applications with significant data availability requirements such as machine learning and artificial intelligence. Data replication provides one avenue by which CIS data can be made more readily available. Study Design and Methods: Members of the AABB's Information Systems Committee along with institutional information technology colleagues provided a multi-institutional viewpoint on data replication through the lens of BCTS specific use cases. Case studies of informatics offerings leveraging such technologies were also elicited. Results: Six distinct use cases describe the potential role of data replication including the creation of data warehouses for frontline laboratory staff. Specific BCTS examples for each use case are presented to highlight the value of data replication, including visualization of critical inventory (O red blood cells, HLA-compatible platelets) and utilization analytics for patient blood management. Two case studies describe the approach to implement such technologies to (1) optimize staffing via laboratory workload reporting and (2) improve access to blood via antigen-negative blood product location services. Discussion: Data replication and warehousing can empower BCTS analytic offerings not otherwise natively available through one's CIS to improve patient care and laboratory operations. © 2024 AABB.",blood center operations; blood establishment computer system; informatics; transfusion service operations,Blood Banks; Blood Transfusion; Data Warehousing; Humans; adoption; Article; artificial intelligence; blood; blood and hemopoietic system; blood donor; blood sampling; blood transfusion; caloric intake; cryoprecipitate; data base; data leverage; data processing; data replication; data warehouse; disaster recovery; electronic health record; genotyping; granulocyte; health care personnel; health service; human; immunogenetics; information processing; information storage; information system; information technology; machine learning; medical information system; optimize business reporting; prenatal screening; questionnaire; recall; removing source system burden; supplement clinical application; thrombocyte; thrombocyte transfusion; time series analysis; workload; blood bank; case report; data warehouse; procedures,John Wiley and Sons Inc,,,,Article,Final,

To test the interoperability within the field of oncology research, our team at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) enabled our Epic-based EHR to be compatible with the Minimal Common Oncology Data Elements (mCODE), which is a Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)–based consensus data standard created to facilitate the transmission of EHRs for patients with cancer. METHODS Our approach used an extract, transform, load tool for converting EHR data from the VUMC Epic Clarity database into mCODE-compatible profiles. We established a sandbox environment on Microsoft Azure for data migration, deployed a FHIR server to handle application programming interface (API) requests, and mapped VUMC data to align with mCODE structures. In addition, we constructed a web application to demonstrate the practical use of mCODE profiles in health care. RESULTS We developed an end-to-end pipeline that converted EHR data into mCODE-compliant profiles, as well as a web application that visualizes genomic data and provides cancer risk assessments. Despite the complexities of aligning traditional EHR databases with mCODE standards and the limitations of FHIR APIs in supporting advanced statistical methodologies, this project successfully demonstrates the practical integration of mCODE standards into existing health care infrastructures. CONCLUSION This study provides a proof of concept for the interoperability of mCODE within a major health care institution’s EHR system, highlighting both the potential and the current limitations of FHIR APIs in supporting complex data analysis for oncology research. © 2024 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",,Academic Medical Centers; Common Data Elements; Electronic Health Records; Genomics; Health Information Interoperability; Humans; Medical Oncology; Neoplasms; Pilot Projects; Software; Article; cancer risk; consensus; electronic health record; Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources; genomics; human; incidence; risk assessment; university hospital; common data elements; data interoperability; genetics; neoplasm; oncology; pilot study; procedures; software,Lippincott Williams and Wilkins,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access

Lack of standardization hinders the coordination between systems and stakeholders, impacting continuity of care and patient outcomes. Common musculoskeletal conditions affect people of all ages and can have a significant impact on quality of life. With physical activity and rehabilitation, these conditions can be mitigated, promoting recovery and preventing recurrence. Proper management of patient data allows for clinical decision support, facilitating personalized interventions and a patient-centered approach. Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is a widely adopted standard that defines healthcare concepts with the objective of easing information exchange and enabling interoperability throughout the healthcare sector, reducing implementation complexity without losing information integrity. This article explores the literature that reviews the contemporary role of FHIR, approaching its functioning, benefits, and challenges, and presents a methodology for structuring several types of health and wellbeing data, that can be routinely collected as observations and then encapsulated in FHIR resources, to ensure interoperability across systems. These were developed considering health industry standard guidelines, technological specifications, and using the experience gained from the implementation in various study cases, within European health-related research projects, to assess its effectiveness in the exchange of patient data in existing healthcare systems towards improving musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). © 2024 by the authors.",data collection; electronic health records; FHIR; internet of things; MSD,Data Collection; Delivery of Health Care; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Musculoskeletal Diseases; Precision Medicine; Quality of Life; Wearable Electronic Devices; Clinical research; Musculoskeletal system; Records management; Condition; Data collection; Electronic health; Fast healthcare interoperability resource; Health data; Health records; Healthcare Interoperability; Healthcare systems; Musculoskeletal disorders; Patient data; electronic health record; health care delivery; human; information processing; musculoskeletal disease; personalized medicine; procedures; quality of life; therapy; wearable computer; Electronic health record,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

Methods: We performed a qualitative needs assessment, designed the IT tools to support the weight management program, and developed implementation tracking metrics. Implementation tracking metrics were designed to use real world electronic health record (EHR) data. Results: The needs assessment revealed IT requirements as well as barriers and facilitators to implementation of EHR-based weight management interventions in primary care. We developed implementation metrics for the IT tools. These metrics were used in weekly project team calls to make sure that project resources were allocated to areas of need. Conclusion: This study identifies the important role of IT in supporting weight management through patient identification, weight and activity tracking in the patient portal, and the use of the EHR as a population management tool. An intensive multi-level implementation approach is required for successful primary care-based weight management interventions including well-designed IT tools, comprehensive involvement of clinic leadership, and implementation tracking metrics to guide the process of workflow integration.

This requirement becomes more powerful if EHI exports use interoperable application programming interfaces (APIs). We sought to advance the ecosystem, instantiating policy desiderata in a working reference implementation based on a consensus design. Materials and Methods: We formulate a model for interoperable, patient-controlled, app-driven access to EHI exports in an open source reference implementation following the Argonaut FHIR Accelerator consensus implementation guide for EHI Export. Results: The reference implementation, which asynchronously provides EHI across an API, has three central components: a web application for patients to request EHI exports, an EHI server to respond to requests, and an administrative export management web application to manage requests. It leverages mandated SMART on FHIR/Bulk FHIR APIs. Discussion: A patient-controlled app enabling full EHI export from any EHR across an API could facilitate national-scale patient-directed information exchange. We hope releasing these tools sparks engagement from the health IT community to evolve the design, implement and test in real-world settings, and develop patient-facing apps. Conclusion: To advance regulatory innovation, we formulate a model that builds on existing requirements under the Cures Act Rule and takes a step toward an interoperable, scalable approach, simplifying patient access to their own health data; supporting the sharing of clinical data for both improved patient care and medical research; and encouraging the growth of an ecosystem of third-party applications.  © 2024 The Author(s).

However, resources required to connect individuals with needed social and community services typically exceed the available staffing within clinical teams. Using input from focus groups, key informant interviews, user experience/user interface testing, and a multidisciplinary community advisory board, we developed a new technology solution, ConnectedNest, which connects individuals in need to community based organizations (CBOs) that provide services through direct and/or oncology team referrals, with interfaces to support all three groups (patients, CBOs, and oncology care teams). After prototype development, we conducted usability testing, with participants noting the importance of the technology for filling a current gap in screening and connecting individuals with cancer with needed social and community services. We employ a patient-empowered approach that engages the support of an individual's healthcare team and community organizations. Future work will examine the integration and implementation of ConnectedNest for oncology patients, oncology care teams, and cancer-focused CBOs to build capacity for effectively addressing distress in this population.  © The Author(s), 2024.",community based organizations; mobile health information technology; oncology practices; patient-centered design; Social determinants of health,adult; adverse outcome; Article; caregiver; case study; clinical practice; community; female; financial distress; food insecurity; housing instability; human; integrated health care system; major clinical study; male; medical informatics; multidisciplinary team; oncology; patient empowerment; patient referral; person centered care; screening; social needs; social welfare; social work; support group; telehealth; usability testing,Cambridge University Press,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

In recent years, the adoption of cloud-based Electronic Health Records (EHR) sharing schemes has yielded numerous advantages like improved accessibility, availability, and enhanced interoperability. However, the centralized nature of cloud storage presents challenges in terms of information storage, privacy protection, and security. Despite several approaches that have been presented to ensure secure deduplication of similar EHRs, the validation of data integrity without a third-party auditor (TPA) remains a persistent task. Because involving a TPA raises concerns about the confidentiality and privacy of crucial healthcare information. To tackle this challenge, a novel cloud storage auditing technique is proposed that incorporates cross-patient block-level deduplication while upholding strong privacy protection, ensuring that EHR is not compromised. Here, we introduced blockchain technology to achieve integrity verification, thus eliminating the need for a TPA by providing a decentralized and transparent mechanism. Additionally, an index for all EHRs has been generated to facilitate block-level duplicate checks and employ a novel strategy to prevent adversaries from acquiring original information saved in the cloud storage. The security of the proposed approach is established against factorization attacks and decrypt exponent attacks.

226,Walinjkar A.,A composite and wearable sensor kit for location-aware healthcare monitoring and real-time trauma scoring for survival prediction,2018,Applied System Innovation,1.0,10.3390/asi1030035,"With the advances in the microfabrication of analogue front-end devices, and embedded and signal processing technology, it has now become possible to devise miniaturized health monitoring kits for non-invasive real time monitoring at any location. The current commonly available kits only measure singleton physiological parameters, and a composite analysis that covers all vital signs and trauma scores seems to be missing with these kits. The research aims at using vital signs and other physiological parameters to calculate trauma scores National Early Warning Score (NEWS), Revised Trauma Score (RTS), Trauma Score-Injury Severity Score (TRISS) and Prediction of survival (Ps), and to log the trauma event to electronic health records using standard coding schemes. The signal processing algorithms were implemented in MATLAB and could be ported to TI AM335x using MATLAB/Embedded Coder. Motion artefacts were removed using a level ‘5’ stationary wavelet transform and a ‘sym4’ wavelet, which yielded a signal-to-noise ratio of 27.83 dB. To demonstrate the operation of the device, an existing Physionet, MIMIC II Numerics dataset was used to calculate NEWS and RTS scores, and to generate the correlation and regression models for a clinical class of patients with respiratory failure and admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Parameters such as age, heart rate, Systolic Blood Pressure (SysBP), respiratory rate, and Oxygen Saturation (SpO2) as predictors to Ps, showed significant positive regressions of 93% at p < 0.001. The NEWS and RTS scores showed no significant correlation (r = 0.25, p < 0.001) amongst themselves; however, the NEWS and RTS together showed significant correlations with Ps (blunt) (r = 0.70, p < 0.001). RTS and Ps (blunt) scores showed some correlations (r = 0.63, p < 0.001), and the NEWS score showed significant correlation (r = 0.79, p < 0.001) with Ps (blunt) scores. Global Positioning System (GPS) system was built into the kit to locate the individual and to calculate the shortest path to the nearest healthcare center using the Quantum Geographical Information System (QGIS) Network Analysis tool. The physiological parameters from the sensors, along with the calculated trauma scores, were encoded according to a standard Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT) coding system, and the trauma information was logged to electronic health records using Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR) servers. The FHIR servers provided interoperable web services to log the trauma event information in real time and to prepare for medical emergencies. © 2018 by the author.

Many efforts have been made to transform paper-based patient data to automated medical information by developing electronic healthcare records (EHRs). Several international EHRs standards have been enabling healthcare interoperability and communication among a wide variety of medical centres. It is a dual-model methodology which comprises a reference information model and an archetype model. The archetype is responsible for the definition of clinical concepts which has limitations in terms of supporting complex reasoning and knowledge discovery requirements. The objective of this article is to propose a semantic-mediation architecture to support semantic interoperability among healthcare organizations. It provides an intermediate semantic layer to exploit clinical information based on richer ontological representations to create a ""model of meaning"" for enabling semantic mediation.

METHODS We assessed cancer-related molecular marker test data availability across 12 US health care systems in the Cancer Research Network. Overall, these systems provide care to a diverse population of more than 12 million people in the United States. We performed qualitative analyses of test data availability for five blood-based protein, nine germline, and 14 tissue-based tumor marker tests in each health care system's electronic health record and tumor registry using key informants, test code lists, and manual review of data types and output. We then performed quantitative analyses to estimate the proportion of patients with cancer with test utilization data and results for specific molecular marker tests. RESULTS Health systems were able to systematically capture population-level data on all five blood protein markers, six of 14 tissue-based tumor markers, and none of the nine germline markers. Successful, systematic data capture was achievable for tests with electronic data feeds for test results (blood protein markers) or through prior manual abstraction by tumor registrars (select tumor-based markers). For test results stored in scanned image files (particularly germline and tumor marker tests), information on which test was performed and test results was not readily accessible in an electronic format. CONCLUSION Even in health care systems with sophisticated electronic health records, there were few codified data elements available for evaluating precision cancer medicine test use and results at the population level. Health care organizations should establish standards for electronic reporting of precision medicine tests to expedite cancer research and facilitate the implementation of precision medicine approaches. © 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology",,"Biomarkers, Tumor; Data Collection; Delivery of Health Care; Disease Management; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Liquid Biopsy; Molecular Diagnostic Techniques; Neoplasms; Precision Medicine; Public Health Surveillance; Research; United States; alpha fetoprotein; anaplastic lymphoma kinase; B Raf kinase; BRCA1 protein; BRCA2 protein; CA 125 antigen; CA 19-9 antigen; carcinoembryonic antigen; DNA glycosylase MutY; DNA mismatch repair protein MSH2; epidermal growth factor receptor; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; epithelial cell adhesion molecule; estrogen receptor; K ras protein; mismatch repair protein PMS2; molecular marker; MutL protein homolog 1; progesterone receptor; programmed death 1 ligand 1; prostate specific antigen; protein MSH6; protein Ret; scatter factor receptor; seprase; tumor marker; tumor marker; Article; cancer registry; cancer research; cancer screening; electronic health record; health care system; personalized medicine; priority journal; qualitative analysis; screening test; United States; disease management; electronic health record; health care delivery; health survey; human; information processing; liquid biopsy; molecular diagnosis; neoplasm; personalized medicine; research",American Society of Clinical Oncology,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access

Every activity from authorized entities is recorded immutably in the blockchain transactions. In terms of privacy, the e-health system preserves a default privacy option as an initial state for every patient since the patients may frequently customize their medical data over time for several purposes. Moreover, adjustments in the patient’s privacy contexts are often solely from the patient’s initiative without any doctor or stakeholders’ recommendation. Therefore, we design, implement, and evaluate user-defined data privacy utilizing nudge theory for decentralized e-health systems named PDPM to tackle these issues. Patients can determine the privacy of their medical records to be closed to certain parties. Data privacy management is dynamic, which can be executed on the blockchain via the smart contract feature. Tamper-proof user-defined data privacy can resolve the dispute between the e-health entities related to privacy management and adjustments. In short, the authorized entities cannot deny any changes since every activity is recorded in the ledgers. Meanwhile, the nudge theory technique supports providing the best patient privacy recommendations based on their behaviour activities even though the final decision rests on the patient. Finally, we demonstrate how to use PDPM to realize user-defined data privacy management in decentralized e-health environments.

The number of health screening tests, many of which have been developed with machine learning or genomics, has exploded. To assess efficacy of health screening, ideally, randomized trials of screening in youth would be conducted; however, these can take years to conduct and may not be feasible. Thus, innovative methods to evaluate the long-term outcomes of screening are needed to help clinicians and policymakers make informed decisions. These methods include using longitudinal and linked-data systems to evaluate screening in clinical and community settings, school data, simulation modeling approaches, and methods that take advantage of data available in the digital and genomic age. Future research is needed to evaluate how longitudinal and linked-data systems drawing on community and clinical settings can enable robust evaluations of the effects of screening on changes in health status. Additionally, future studies are needed to benchmark participating individuals and communities against similar counterparts and to link big data with natural experiments related to variation in screening policies. These novel approaches have great potential for identifying and addressing differences in access to screening and effectiveness of screening across population groups and communities.

With the need for suitable opioid use interventions, we present a conceptual design of an m-health intervention that addresses the various known interacting factors of opioid use and corresponding evidence-based practices. The visualization of the opioid use complexities is presented as the “Opioid Cube”. Methods: Following Stage 0 to Stage IA of the NIH Stage Model, we used guidelines and extant health intervention literature on opioid apps to inform the Opioid Intervention (O-INT) design. We present our design using system architecture, algorithms, and user interfaces to integrate multiple functions including decision support. We evaluate the proposed O-INT using analytical modeling. Results: The conceptual design of O-INT supports the concept of collaborative care, by providing connections between the patient, healthcare professionals, and their family members. The evaluation of O-INT shows a preference for specific functions, such as overdose detection and potential for high system reliability with minimal side effects. The Opioid Cube provides a visualization of various opioid use states and their influencing and interacting factors. Conclusions: O-INT is a promising design with a holistic approach to manage opioid use and prevent and treat misuse. With several needed functionalities, O-INT design serves as a decision support system for patients, healthcare professionals, researchers, and policy makers.

Many organisations are already partially automating drug coding using text-processing methods and synonym lists, however addressing challenges such as misspellings, abbreviations or ambiguous trade names requires more advanced methods. WHODrug Koda is a drug coding engine using text-processing algorithms, built-in coding rules and machine learning to code drug verbatims to WHODrug Global. Objective: Our aim was to evaluate the drug coding performance of WHODrug Koda on AE reports from VigiBase, the World Health Organization’s global database of individual case safety reports, in terms of level of automation and coding quality. Methods: Koda was evaluated on 4.8 million drug entries from VigiBase. Automation level was computed as the proportion of drug entries automatically coded by Koda and was compared to a simple case-insensitive text-matching algorithm. Coding quality was evaluated in terms of coding accuracy, by comparing Koda’s prediction to the WHODrug entries found on the AE reports in VigiBase. To better understand the cases in which Koda’s coding results did not match with the WHODrug entries in VigiBase, a manual assessment of 600 samples of disagreeing encodings was performed by two teams of expert drug coders. Results: Compared with a simple direct-match baseline, Koda can increase the automation level from 61% to 89%, while providing high coding quality with an accuracy of 97%. Conclusions: Even though Koda was designed for use in clinical trials, Koda achieves automation level and coding quality for drug coding of AE reports comparable with the performance observed in a previous evaluation of Koda on clinical trial data. Koda can thus help organisations to automate their drug coding of AE reports to a large degree. © 2022, The Author(s).",,"Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Automation; Databases, Factual; Humans; Machine Learning; adalimumab; adapalene; ascorbic acid; calcium; colecalciferol; corticotropin; fumaric acid; ketotifen; lenalidomide; omeprazole; paracetamol; probiotic agent; ranitidine; accuracy; adverse event; algorithm; Article; artificial intelligence; automated drug coding; automation; clinical trial (topic); coding; consumer; data base; drug marketing; drug safety; evaluation study; France; Germany; gold standard; health care organization; health practitioner; Korea; lawyer; machine learning; natural language processing; pharmacist; United Kingdom; United States; WHODrug Koda; word processing; algorithm; factual database; human",Adis,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access

As a potential resolution, we explore an alternative approach wherein a graphical interface that automatically generates the SQL queries is used to perform the analysis. The latter allows clinical experts to directly perform complex queries on the data, despite their unfamiliarity with SQL syntax. The interface provides an intuitive understanding of the query logic which makes the analysis transparent and comprehensible to the clinical study-staff, thereby enhancing the transparency and validity of the analysis. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using a user-friendly interface that automatically generate SQL for analysis of health data.

Mendelian risk prediction models translate family histories into cancer risk predictions, based on knowledge of cancer susceptibility genes. These models are widely used in clinical practice to help identify high-risk individuals. Mendelian models leverage the entire family history, but they rely on many assumptions about cancer susceptibility genes that are either unrealistic or challenging to validate, due to low mutation prevalence. Training more flexible models, such as neural networks, on large databases of pedigrees can potentially lead to ac-curacy gains. In this paper we develop a framework to apply neural networks to family history data and investigate their ability to learn inherited susceptibility to cancer. While there is an extensive literature on neural networks and their state-of-the-art performance in many tasks, there is little work applying them to family history data. We propose adaptations of fully-connected neural networks and convolutional neural networks to pedigrees. In data simulated under Mendelian inheritance, we demonstrate that our proposed neural network models are able to achieve nearly optimal prediction performance. Moreover, when the observed family history includes misreported cancer di-agnoses, neural networks are able to outperform the Mendelian BRCAPRO model embedding the correct inheritance laws. Using a large dataset of over 200,000 family histories, the Risk Service cohort, we train prediction models for future risk of breast cancer. We validate the models using data from the Cancer Genetics Network. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2022.",family history; Machine learning; Mendelian risk prediction,,Institute of Mathematical Statistics,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access

In this perspective, we describe our experiences in implementing the TREWScore, a septic shock EWS, and the transportability challenges regarding domain, predictors, and clinical outcome we faced. We used data of 53,330 ICU stays from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) and 18,013 ICU stays from the University Medical Center (UMC) Utrecht, including 17,023 (31.9%) and 2,557 (14.2%) cases of sepsis, respectively.

We mapped all 54 TREWScore predictors to the UMC database: 31 were readily available, seven required unit conversion, 14 had to be engineered, one predictor required text mining, and one predictor could not be mapped. Lastly, we classified sepsis cases for septic shock using the sepsis-2 criteria. Septic shock populations (UMC 31.3% and MIMIC-III 23.3%) and time to shock events showed significant differences between the two cohorts. In conclusion, we identified challenges to transportability and implementation regarding domain, predictors, and clinical outcome when transporting EWS between hospitals across two continents. These challenges need to be systematically addressed to improve model transportability between centers and unlock the potential clinical utility of EWS.

To fully extract value from PGD, health care organizations must be able to smoothly integrate data from PGD devices into routine clinical workflows. Ideally, to enhance efficiency and flexibility, such integrations should follow reusable processes that can easily be replicated for multiple devices and data types. Instead, current PGD integrations tend to be one-off efforts entailing high costs to build and maintain custom connections with each device and their proprietary data formats. This viewpoint paper formulates the integration of PGD into clinical systems and workflow as a PGD integration pipeline and reviews the functional components of such a pipeline. A PGD integration pipeline includes PGD acquisition, aggregation, and consumption. Acquisition is the person-facing component that includes both technical (eg, sensors, smartphone apps) and policy components (eg, informed consent). Aggregation pools, standardizes, and structures data into formats that can be used in health care settings such as within electronic health record–based workflows. PGD consumption is wide-ranging, by different solutions in different care settings (inpatient, outpatient, consumer health) for different types of users (clinicians, patients). The adoption of data and metadata standards, such as those from IEEE and Open mHealth, would facilitate aggregation and enable broader consumption. We illustrate the benefits of a standards-based integration pipeline for the illustrative use case of home blood pressure monitoring. A standards-based PGD integration pipeline can flexibly streamline the clinical use of PGD while accommodating the complexity, scale, and rapid evolution of today’s health care systems. ©Billy Zeng, Riley Bove, Simona Carini, Jonathan Shing-Jih Lee, JP Pollak, Erica Schleimer, Ida Sim.",Data sharing; Health care; Mobile health; Patient-generated health data; Telemedicine,Delivery of Health Care; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Mobile Applications; Reference Standards; Telemedicine; electronic health record; health care delivery; human; mobile application; standard; telemedicine,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access
243,Cihoric N.; Badra E.V.; Stenger-Weisser A.; Aebersold D.M.; Pavic M.,Toward Data-Driven Radiation Oncology Using Standardized Terminology as a Starting Point: Cross-sectional Study,2022,JMIR Formative Research,1.0,10.2196/27550,"Background: The inability to seamlessly exchange information across radiation therapy ecosystems is a limiting factor in the pursuit of data-driven clinical practice. The implementation of semantic interoperability is a prerequisite for achieving the full capacity of the latest developments in personalized and precision medicine, such as mathematical modeling, advanced algorithmic information processing, and artificial intelligence approaches. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the state of terminology resources (TRs) dedicated to radiation oncology as a prerequisite for an oncology semantic ecosystem. The goal of this cross-sectional analysis is to quantify the state of the art in radiation therapy specific terminology. Methods: The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) was searched for the following terms: radio oncology, radiation oncology, radiation therapy, and radiotherapy. We extracted 6509 unique concepts for further analysis. We conducted a quantitative analysis of available source vocabularies (SVs) and analyzed all UMLS SVs according to the route source, number, author, location of authors, license type, the lexical density of TR, and semantic types. Descriptive data are presented as numbers and percentages. Results: The concepts were distributed across 35 SVs. The median number of unique concepts per SV was 5 (range 1-5479), with 14% (5/35) of SVs containing 94.59% (6157/6509) of the concepts. The SVs were created by 29 authors, predominantly legal entities registered in the United States (25/35, 71%), followed by international organizations (6/35, 17%), legal entities registered in Australia (2/35, 6%), and the Netherlands and the United Kingdom with 3% (1/35) of authors each. Of the total 35 SVs, 16 (46%) did not have any restrictions on use, whereas for 19 (54%) of SVs, some level of restriction was required. Overall, 57% (20/35) of SVs were updated within the last 5 years. All concepts found within radiation therapy SVs were labeled with one of the 29 semantic types represented within UMLS. After removing the stop words, the total number of words for all SVs together was 56,219, with a median of 25 unique words per SV (range 3-50,682). The total number of unique words in all SVs was 1048, with a median of 19 unique words per vocabulary (range 3-406). The lexical density for all concepts within all SVs was 0 (0.02 rounded to 2 decimals). Median lexical density per unique SV was 0.7 (range 0.0-1.0). There were no dedicated radiation therapy SVs. Conclusions: We did not identify any dedicated TRs for radiation oncology. Current terminologies are not sufficient to cover the need of modern radiation oncology practice and research. To achieve a sufficient level of interoperability, of the creation of a new, standardized, universally accepted TR dedicated to modern radiation therapy is required. ©Nikola Cihoric, Eugenia Vlaskou Badra, Anna Stenger-Weisser, Daniel M Aebersold, Matea Pavic.",EHealth; Informatics; Lexical analysis; Medical informatics; Oncology; Radiation oncology; Semantic interoperability; Terminology,,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

Since electronic health record (EHR) systems are required to make patient data available to external systems, an interface between EHRs and recruitment registries may improve accuracy and completeness of volunteers' profiles. We tested this hypothesis on ResearchMatch (RM), a disease- and institution-neutral recruitment registry with 1357 studies across 255 institutions. Methods: We developed an interface where volunteers signing up for RM can authorize transfer of demographic data, medical conditions, and medications from the EHR into a registration form. We obtained feedback from a panel of community members to determine acceptability of the planned integration. We then developed the EHR interface and performed an evaluation study of 100 patients to determine whether RM profiles generated with EHR-assisted adjudication included more conditions and medications than those without the EHR connection. Results: Community member feedback revealed that members of the public were willing to authenticate into the EHR from RM with proper messaging about choice and privacy. The evaluation study showed that out of 100 participants, 75 included more conditions and 69 included more medications in RM profiles completed with the EHR connection than those without. Participants also completed the EHR-connected profiles in 16 fewer seconds than non-EHR-connected profiles. Conclusions: The EHR to RM integration could lead to more complete profiles, less participant burden, and better study matches for many of the over 148,000 volunteers who participate in ResearchMatch.  © The Author(s), 2023.

Interoperability, in the context of this article, is “the ability to share information across time and space from multiple devices, sources, and organizations,” as defined by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers). The review is followed by recommendations for future work toward improving the standardization of heterogeneous data in the healthcare setting. Methods: A literature review was conducted on established interoperability standards and systems in healthcare based on information obtained from journal publications, government and academy reports, published materials, and publicly available websites. Emphasis is placed on four interoperability parameters: device/equipment interoperability, compatibility issues, involved organizations, and migration and conversion issues. It evaluates adoption levels for each standard, as well as factors supporting and/or limiting systemic adoption. Estimations on the number of users—medical professionals and patients—for each system were made when verifiable data were available. Examples of specific interoperability efforts and an evaluation of their feasibility were conducted at three levels of healthcare interoperability, as defined by the National Academy of Medicine: Inter-facility interoperability, Intra-facility interoperability, and Point-of-care interoperability. Results: After reviewing the following interoperability initiatives: Health Level 7 (HL7), Consolidated-Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDA), Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM), Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise International (IHE), Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), Argonaut, Direct Standard, Validated Healthcare Directory (VHDir), Health Quality Measures Format (HQMF), Health Relationship Trust (HEART), and Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) which operate in various clinical domains, it is clear that while progress has been achieved locally, greater semantic understandability during information exchange is necessary. Greater detail is presented in each section. Conclusions: Despite many parallel ongoing efforts to improve the standardization of healthcare information in the mobile devices, IoT (Internet of Things), and EHR (electronic health records) sectors, there is still space for improvement. The U.S. must develop and implement effective mechanisms to surmount boundaries blocking the transfer of diverse types of healthcare information. © 2023, Partners in Digital Health.

Integrating diverse databases in the same area faces three major challenges that make solving the heterogeneity problem difficult. Semantic, syntactic, and structural heterogeneity are the three concerns. It also makes it tough to cope with semantic heterogeneity issues. In practice, difficulties such as missing sensory data and aberrant values caused by device failure still exist when assessing existing heterogeneous integrated data. This research study presents a Semantic Integration of Heterogeneous Healthcare Data based on Hybrid Root Linked Health Record (LHR) Ontology to overcome the drawbacks. We used semantic web technologies to connect various healthcare data from multiple devices. In addition, this study proposes a hybrid root LHR ontology, which samples health data from various databases. This ontology modeling has two different stages. In the first stage, the ontology rules were to translate the database rules to find an abstract ontology model and entropy mapping. Secondly, to expand the abstract ontology model according to the databases. This approach enables searching databases using SPARQL queries. As a result, the API is utilized to find semantically comparable records. The proposed experimental result has a accuracy of 99%, which is comparable to the existing GLAV accuracy of 92%, Fuzzy accuracy of 91%, and the LHR and SYMP accuracy of 95% and 93%, respectively. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",API; Data integration; Hybrid root & LHR ontology; IoT; RDF; SPARQL,database; health care; heterogeneity; information technology; Internet; semantic standardization,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,,Article,Final,

Pfizer previously developed a machine learning model that performed well in identifying wild-type transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy vs. nonamyloid heart failure. However, challenges exist when introducing machine learning applications into healthcare, mainly due to restrictions on sharing patient data. This requires the triggering and execution of the model outside the developer's infrastructure using hosts with diverse information technology capabilities. With these barriers in mind, we investigated architectural designs to facilitate the delivery of the model to the customer. We considered manageability and scalability of the model, the host's information technology maturity, maintenance of patient data privacy, and protection of Pfizer's intellectual property. A container-based design, wherein the application is shipped as a container image to a third-party platform, fulfilled these criteria and was piloted on a platform hosted by Philips. Objectives of this pilot included defining and testing the architectural design and technical parameters for sharing the container image, creating a scalable and modular framework to manage multiple applications on different third-party platforms, and exploring a communication pattern based on clinical decision support Hooks/Cards and representational state transfer calls within the Philips platform. Implementing the model may enable earlier identification and treatment of wild-type transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy, and learnings from this pilot may lead to improved delivery of other machine learning models to healthcare providers, thereby increasing utilization.

CDS can be designed to save health care providers time and help them provide safe and personalized analgesic prescribing. Objective: The aim of this report is to describe the development of a CDS system designed to provide dentists with personalized pain management recommendations to reduce opioid prescribing following extractions. The use of CDS is also examined. Methods: This study was conducted in HealthPartners, which uses an electronic health record (EHR) system that integrates both medical and dental information upon which the CDS application was developed based on SMART (Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technologies) on FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources). The various tools used to bring relevant medical conditions, medications, patient history, and other relevant data into the CDS interface are described. The CDS application runs a drug interaction algorithm developed by our organization and provides patient-specific recommendations. The CDS included access to the state Prescription Monitoring Program database. Implementation (Results): The pain management CDS was implemented as part of a study examining opioid prescribing among patients undergoing dental extraction procedures from February 17, 2020, to May 14, 2021. Provider-level use of CDS at extraction encounters ranged from 0% to 87.4% with 12.1% of providers opening the CDS for no encounters, 39.4% opening the CDS for 1%-20% of encounters, 36.4% opening it for 21%-50% of encounters, and 12.1% opening it for 51%-87% of encounters. Conclusions: The pain management CDS is an EHR-embedded, provider-facing tool to help dentists make personalized pain management recommendations following dental extractions. The SMART on FHIR–based pain management CDS adapted well to the point-of-care dental setting and led to the design of a scalable CDS tool that is EHR vendor agnostic. ©D Brad Rindal, Dhavan Prasad Pasumarthi, Vijayakumar Thirumalai, Anjali R Truitt, Stephen E Asche, Donald C Worley, Sheryl M Kane, Jan Gryczynski, Shannon G Mitchell.",algorithm; analgesics; application; clinical decision support systems; decision support; dentistry; dentists; design; development; EHR; electronic health records; Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources; FHIR; implementation; pain management; patient care; SMART; Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technologies; tool,,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access
251,Nakikj D.; Kreda D.; Gehlenborg N.,New Ways for Patients to Make Sense of Their Electronic Health Record Data Using the Discovery Web Application: Think-Aloud Evaluation Study,2023,JMIR Formative Research,1.0,10.2196/41346,"Background: In the United States, patients can access their electronic health record (EHR) data through patient portals. However, current patient portals are mainly focused on a single provider, with very limited data sharing capabilities and put low emphasis on independent sensemaking of the EHR data. This makes it very challenging for patients to switch between different portals and aggregate the data to obtain a complete picture of their medical history and to make sense of it. Owing to this fragmentation, patients are exposed to numerous inconveniences such as medical errors, repeated tests, and limited self-advocacy. Objective: To overcome the limitations of EHR patient portals, we designed and developed Discovery—a web-based application that aggregates EHR data from multiple providers and present them to the patient for efficient exploration and sensemaking. To learn how well Discovery meets the patients’ sensemaking needs and what features should such applications include, we conducted an evaluation study. Methods: We conducted a remote study with 14 participants. In a 60-minute session and relying on the think-aloud protocol, participants were asked to complete a variety of sensemaking tasks and provide feedback upon completion. The audio materials were transcribed for analysis and the video recordings of the users’ interactions with Discovery were annotated to provide additional context. These combined textual data were thematically analyzed to surface themes that reflect how participants used Discovery’s features, what sensemaking of their EHR data really entails, and what features are desirable to support that process better. Results: We found that Discovery provided much needed features and could be used in a variety of everyday scenarios, especially for preparing and during clinical visits and also for raising awareness, reflection, and planning. According to the study participants, Discovery provided a robust set of features for supporting independent exploration and sensemaking of their EHR data: summary and quick overview of the data, finding prevalence, periodicity, co-occurrence, and pre-post of medical events, as well as comparing medical record types and subtypes across providers. In addition, we extracted important design implications from the user feedback on data exploration with multiple views and nonstandard user interface elements. Conclusions: Patient-centered sensemaking tools should have a core set of features that can be learned quickly and support common use cases for a variety of users. The patients should be able to detect time-oriented patterns of medical events and get enough context and explanation on demand in a single exploration view that feels warm and familiar and relies on patient-friendly language. However, this view should have enough plasticity to adjust to the patient’s information needs as the sensemaking unfolds. Future designs should include the physicians in the patient’s sensemaking process and improve the communication in clinical visits and via messaging. © Drashko Nakikj, David Kreda, Nils Gehlenborg.",design; electronic health records; multiple providers; patient; personal health records; sensemaking,,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

Voice assistants can improve clinical workflows by allowing natural language queries and contextually aware navigation of the EHR. Objectives: To develop a voice-mediated EHR assistant and interview providers to inform its future refinement. Methods: The Vanderbilt EHR Voice Assistant (VEVA) was developed as a responsive web application and designed to accept voice inputs and execute the appropriate EHR commands. Fourteen providers from Vanderbilt Medical Center were recruited to participate in interactions with VEVA and to share their experience with the technology. The purpose was to evaluate VEVA's overall usability, gather qualitative feedback, and detail suggestions for enhancing its performance. Results: VEVA's mean system usability scale score was 81 based on the 14 providers' evaluations, which was above the standard 50th percentile score of 68. For all five summaries evaluated (overview summary, A1C results, blood pressure, weight, and health maintenance), most providers offered a positive review of VEVA. Several providers suggested modifications to make the technology more useful in their practice, ranging from summarizing current medications to changing VEVA's speech rate. Eight of the providers (64%) reported they would be willing to use VEVA in its current form. Conclusion: Our EHR voice assistant technology was deemed usable by most providers. With further improvements, voice assistant tools such as VEVA have the potential to improve workflows and serve as a useful adjunct tool in health care.  © 2024. Thieme.

However, the lack of compatibility in health data formats and services across devices from different manufacturers hinders the growth of AIoT-based healthcare services. To address this issue, we propose a unified system for the collection of raw sensor data from smart devices (i.e., smartphones and smartwatches) of various manufacturers as well as health survey data. The data collection application part of our system is available on Android, Wear OS and iOS, and stores data on a oneM2M-based Internet of Things platform via representational state transfer application programmable interfaces. Using the system, we collected data from 300 participants over the course of 60 days. After collecting the data, we analyzed the data set and then proposed a method to archive health-related lifelog in a standardized manner following the fast healthcare interoperability resources (FHIRs) protocol.

Methods: We advance a model for scalable, federated, data sharing and learning. Cumulus software is designed to address key technology and policy desiderata including local utility, control, and administrative simplicity as well as privacy preservation during robust data sharing, and artificial intelligence (AI) for processing unstructured text. Results: Cumulus relies on containerized, cloud-hosted software, installed within a healthcare organization's security envelope. Cumulus accesses EHR data via the Bulk FHIR interface and streamlines automated processing and sharing. The modular design enables use of the latest AI and natural language processing tools and supports provider autonomy and administrative simplicity. In an initial test, Cumulus was deployed across 5 healthcare systems each partnered with public health. Cumulus output is patient counts which were aggregated into a table stratifying variables of interest to enable population health studies. All code is available open source. A policy stipulating that only aggregate data leave the institution greatly facilitated data sharing agreements. Discussion and Conclusion: Cumulus addresses barriers to data sharing based on (1) federally required support for standard APIs, (2) increasing use of cloud computing, and (3) advances in AI.

Despite the abundance of medical data across various facilities — including hospitals, outpatient clinics, and physician practices — the intersectoral exchange of information remains largely hindered due to differences in data structure, content, and adherence to data protection regulations. In response to this challenge, the Medical Informatics Initiative (MII) was launched in Germany, focusing initially on university hospitals to foster the exchange and utilization of real-world data through the development of standardized methods and tools, including the creation of a common core dataset. Our aim, as part of the Medical Informatics Research Hub in Saxony (MiHUBx), is to extend the MII concepts to non-university healthcare providers in a more seamless manner to enable the exchange of real-world data among intersectoral medical sites. Methods: We investigated what services are needed to facilitate the provision of harmonized real-world data for cross-site research. On this basis, we designed a Service Platform Prototype that hosts services for data harmonization, adhering to the globally recognized Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) international standard communication format and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM). Leveraging these standards, we implemented additional services facilitating data utilization, exchange and analysis. Throughout the development phase, we collaborated with an interdisciplinary team of experts from the fields of system administration, software engineering and technology acceptance to ensure that the solution is sustainable and reusable in the long term. Results: We have developed the pre-built packages “ResearchData-to-FHIR,” “FHIR-to-OMOP,” and “Addons,” which provide the services for data harmonization and provision of project-related real-world data in both the FHIR MII Core dataset format (CDS) and the OMOP CDM format as well as utilization and a Service Platform Prototype to streamline data management and use. Conclusion: Our development shows a possible approach to extend the MII concepts to non-university healthcare providers to enable cross-site research on real-world data. Our Service Platform Prototype can thus pave the way for intersectoral data sharing, federated analysis, and provision of SMART-on-FHIR applications to support clinical decision making.

However, many oncologists use third-party laboratories to perform tumor genomic testing, and these laboratories may not have electronic interfaces with the provider's electronic medical record (EMR) system. The resultant reporting mechanisms, such as plain-paper faxing, can reduce report fidelity, slow down reporting procedures for a physician's practice, and make reports less accessible. Vanderbilt University Medical Center and its genomic laboratory testing partner have collaborated to create an automated electronic reporting system that incorporates genetic testing results directly into the clinical EMR. This system was iteratively tested, and causes of failure were discovered and addressed. Most errors were attributable to data entry or typographical errors that made reports unable to be linked to the correct patient in the EMR. By providing direct feedback to providers, we were able to significantly decrease the rate of transmission errors (from 6.29% to 3.84%; P <.001). The results and lessons of 1 year of using the system and transmitting 832 tumor genomic testing reports are reported.

260,Horne W.C.; Miled Z.B.,Making the case for a p2p personal health record,2020,Information (Switzerland),2.0,10.3390/info11110512,"Improved health care services can benefit from a more seamless exchange of medical information between patients and health care providers. This exchange is especially important considering the increasing trends in mobility, comorbidity and outbreaks. However, current Electronic Health Records (EHR) tend to be institution-centric, often leaving the medical information of the patient fragmented and more importantly inaccessible to the patient for sharing with other health providers in a timely manner. Nearly a decade ago, several client–server models for personal health records (PHR) were proposed. The aim of these previous PHRs was to address data fragmentation issues. However, these models were not widely adopted by patients. This paper discusses the need for a new PHR model that can enhance the patient experience by making medical services more accessible. The aims of the proposed model are to (1) help patients maintain a complete lifelong health record, (2) facilitate timely communication and data sharing with health care providers from multiple institutions and (3) promote integration with advanced third-party services (e.g., risk prediction for chronic diseases) that require access to the patient’s health data. The proposed model is based on a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network as opposed to the client–server architecture of the previous PHR models. This architecture consists of a central index server that manages the network and acts as a mediator, a peer client for patients and providers that allows them to manage health records and connect to the network, and a service client that enables third-party providers to offer services to the patients. This distributed architecture is essential since it promotes ownership of the health record by the patient instead of the health care institution. Moreover, it allows the patient to subscribe to an extended range of personalized e-health services. © 2020 by the authors.

Methods  We conducted a survey of research consortia participants engaged in genomic medicine implementation to assess perceived institutional barriers to the adoption of three systems: ClinGen electronic health record (EHR) Toolkit, DocUBuild, and MyResults.org. The survey included eight barriers from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), with additional barriers identified from a qualitative analysis of open-ended responses. Results  We analyzed responses from 24 research consortia participants from 18 institutions. In total, 14 categories of perceived barriers were evaluated, which were consistent with other observed barriers to FOSS adoption. The most frequent perceived barriers included lack of adaptability of the system, lack of institutional priority to implement, lack of trialability, lack of advantage of alternative systems, and complexity. Conclusion  In addition to understanding potential barriers, we recommend some strategies to address them (where possible), including considerations for genomic medicine. Overall, FOSS developers need to ensure systems are easy to trial and implement and need to clearly articulate benefits of their systems, especially when alternatives exist. Institutional champions will remain a critical component to prioritizing genomic medicine projects.  © 2021. Thieme.

Private Health data are required to be transmitted over wireless communication systems where the main problem arising is that of data security and privacy. Various algorithms have been implemented to achieve data privacy. In this work, k-anonymity, differential privacy, k-map, ℓ -diversity and a hybrid of the three algorithms combined with ℓ-diversity have been analyzed using algorithms running on a raspberry pi (edge) for a breast cancer dataset. The results demonstrated a difference in using stand-alone algorithms in terms of output anonymized dataset, execution time, information loss, risk analysis, and statistical analysis. If solely based on its execution time, the hybrids took less than 20 s in comparison to the stand-alone taking nearly 90 s, leading to conclusion that hybrid algorithms are much more suitable in terms of efficiency. Having the option to share anonymized information quicker will reduce financial and admin costs indicating that hybrids should be the main focus even if all algorithms fulfilled their objective of achieving data privacy. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. part of Springer Nature.",Data anonymization; Differential privacy; K-anonymity; K-map; Privacy; ℓ-Diversity,,Springer,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access

We hypothesize that a visual representation of sensitivities may aid in their comprehension. Materials and Methods: a prospective parallel unblinded randomized controlled trial was undertaken at an academic urban tertiary care center. Providers managing emergency department (eD) patients receiving antibiotics and having previous culture sensitivity testing were included. Providers were randomly selected to use standard eHR functionality or a visual representation of patients' past culture data as they answered questions about previous sensitivities. Concordance between provider responses and past cultures was assessed using the kappa statistic. Providers were surveyed about their decision-making and the usability of the tool using Likert scales. Results: 518 eD encounters were screened from 3/5/2018 to 9/30/18, with providers from 144 visits enrolled and analyzed in the intervention arm and 129 in the control arm. Providers using the visualization tool had a kappa of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.65-0.73) when asked about past culture results while the control group had a kappa of 0.16 (95% CI: 0.12-0.20). Providers using the tool expressed improved understanding of previous cultures and found the tool easy to use (P <. 001). Secondary outcomes showed no differences in prescribing practices.

We developed a CDS system that identifies parents who smoke, delivers motivational messages to start treatment, connects parents to treatment, and supports pediatrician-parent discussion. Objective  The objective of this study is to assess the performance of this system in clinical practice, including receipt of motivational messages and tobacco use treatment acceptance rates. Methods  The system was evaluated at one large pediatric practice through a single-arm pilot study from June to November 2021. We collected data on the performance of the CDS system for all parents. Additionally, we surveyed a sample of parents immediately after the clinical encounter who used the system and reported smoking. Measures were: (1) the parent remembered the motivational message, (2) the pediatrician reinforced the message, and (3) treatment acceptance rates. Treatments included nicotine replacement therapy, quitline referral (phone counseling), and/or SmokefreeTXT referral (text message counseling). We described survey response rates overall and with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results  During the entire study period, 8,488 parents completed use of the CDS: 9.3% (n = 786) reported smoking and 48.2% (n = 379) accepted at least one treatment. A total of 102 parents who smoke who used the system were approached to survey 100 parents (98% response rate). Most parents self-identified as female (84%), aged 25 to 34 years (56%), and Black/African American (94%), and had children with Medicaid insurance (95%). Of parents surveyed, 54% accepted at least one treatment option. Most parents recalled the motivational message (79%; 95% CI: 71-87%), and 31% (95% CI: 19-44%) reported that the pediatrician reinforced the motivational message. Conclusion  A CDS system to support parental tobacco use treatment in pediatric primary care enhanced motivational messaging about smoking cessation and evidence-based treatment initiation. © 2022 Georg Thieme Verlag.

In this study, we analyzed posts to an online health community (OHC) that contained a patient's laboratory test results. The objective was to understand the nature of patients' questions related to these data to gain insights into how to better support patients as they individually and collaboratively make sense of their data. We found that patients seek help on the OHC to understand and use their laboratory test results at multiple points in the medical care trajectory. Specifically, in the diagnosis phase, patients tend to be focused on comprehending their data, to be receiving emotionally charged results and, of course, to be engaging the OHC in naming their medical issues. In the treatment phase, patients are often using their laboratory test results to ask more focused questions to identify treatment options, to seek treatment guidance from peers, and to predict the likely course of their disease. Throughout both phases, individuals are highly engaged in the medical process and put in substantial effort to proactively prepare for their care and interactions with doctors. They enlist the OHC in these efforts for many reasons such as a lack of confidence in their doctor. We discuss how gaps in the provision of healthcare services lead to the significant work involved in managing the complex and dynamic interplay between OHCs and the healthcare system. We offer design recommendations both for technologies that provide patients with access to their medical records and for OHCs that will likely continue to play an important role in filling gaps in healthcare services.  © 2022 ACM.",medical care trajectory; medical records; online health community,Diagnosis; Laboratories; Patient treatment; Gain insight; Healthcare IT; Healthcare services; Laboratory test; Medical care trajectory; Medical issues; Medical record; Multiple points; Online health communities; Patient access; Trajectories,Association for Computing Machinery,,,,Article,Final,

Patients and Methods: A risk prediction model was developed and validated in a large observational database of patients with an index visit date between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2016, with treatment effect estimates from risk-based reanalysis of clinical trial data. The risk model development cohort included 1.1 million patients with prediabetes from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse (OLDW); the validation cohort included a distinct sample of 1.1 million patients in OLDW. The randomly assigned clinical trial cohort included 3081 people from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) study. Results: Eleven variables reliably obtainable from the EHR were used to predict diabetes risk. This model validated well in the OLDW (C statistic = 0.76; observed 3-year diabetes rate was 1.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7 to 1.9) in the lowest-risk quarter and 19.6% (19.4 to 19.8) in the highest-risk quarter). In the DPP, the hazard ratio (HR) for lifestyle modification was constant across all levels of risk (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.53), whereas the HR for metformin was highly risk dependent (HR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.61 to 2.0 in the lowest-risk quarter vs HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.59 in the highest-risk quarter). Fifty-three percent of the benefits of population-wide dissemination of the DPP lifestyle modification and 73% of the benefits of population-wide metformin therapy can be obtained by targeting the highest-risk quarter of patients. Conclusion: The Tufts–Predictive Analytics and Comparative Effectiveness DPP Risk model is an EHR-compatible tool that might support targeted diabetes prevention to more efficiently realize the benefits of the DPP interventions. © 2021 The Authors",,"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Metformin; Precision Medicine; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; metformin; triacylglycerol; antidiabetic agent; metformin; adult; Article; clinical assessment; cohort analysis; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; electronic health record; female; follow up; glucose blood level; health care system; human; hypertension; impaired glucose tolerance; lifestyle modification; major clinical study; male; personalized medicine; physical activity; point of care testing; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; shared decision making; systolic blood pressure; validation process; waist circumference; waist hip ratio; electronic health record; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; personalized medicine",Elsevier Ltd,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access

Access to preventive and therapeutic services, biological factors, and social determinants of health (ie, structural racism, resource limitation, residential segregation, and discriminatory practices) all combine to exacerbate health inequities and their resultant disparities in morbidity and mortality. These factors manifest early in life and have been shown to impact health trajectories into adulthood. Early detection of and intervention in emerging risk offers the best hope for preventing race-based differences in adult diseases. However, young-adult populations are notoriously difficult to recruit and retain, often because of a lack of knowledge of personal risk and a low level of concern for long-term health outcomes. Objective: This study aims to develop a system design for the MOYO mobile platform. Further, we seek to addresses the challenge of primordial prevention in a young, at-risk population (ie, Southern-urban African Americans). Methods: Urban African Americans, aged 18 to 29 years (n=505), participated in a series of co-design sessions to develop MOYO prototypes (ie, HealthTech Events). During the sessions, participants were orientated to the issues of CVD risk health disparities and then tasked with wireframing prototype screens depicting app features that they considered desirable. All 297 prototype screens were subsequently analyzed using NVivo 12 (QSR International), a qualitative analysis software. Using the grounded theory approach, an open-coding method was applied to a subset of data, approximately 20% (5/25), or 5 complete prototypes, to identify the dominant themes among the prototypes. To ensure intercoder reliability, 2 research team members analyzed the same subset of data. Results: Overall, 9 dominant design requirements emerged from the qualitative analysis: customization, incentive motivation, social engagement, awareness, education, or recommendations, behavior tracking, location services, access to health professionals, data user agreements, and health assessment. This led to the development of a cross-platform app through an agile design process to collect standardized health surveys, narratives, geolocated pollution, weather, food desert exposure data, physical activity, social networks, and physiology through point-of-care devices. A Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act–compliant cloud infrastructure was developed to collect, process, and review data, as well as generate alerts to allow automated signal processing and machine learning on the data to produce critical alerts. Integration with wearables and electronic health records via fast health care interoperability resources was implemented. Conclusions: The MOYO mobile platform provides a comprehensive health and exposure monitoring system that allows for a broad range of compliance, from passive background monitoring to active self-reporting. These study findings support the notion that African Americans should be meaningfully involved in designing technologies that are developed to improve CVD outcomes in African American communities. © Gari Clifford, Tony Nguyen, Corey Shaw, Brittney Newton, Sherilyn Francis, Mohsen Salari, Chad Evans, Camara Jones, Tabia Henry Akintobi, Herman Taylor Jr. Originally published in JMIR Formative Research (https://formative.jmir.org), 11.01.2022.

Improved transitional care and self-monitoring may reduce preventable readmissions for such high-risk populations. In this study, we will conduct a single-institution randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess the effect of a novel transitional care mobile app, MobiMD, on hospital readmission in complex abdominal surgery patients. Methods: Three hundred patients will be randomized 1:1 to standard of care (SOC) versus SOC plus MobiMD app in a parallel, single-blinded, two-arm RCT. Eligible patients are those who undergo complex abdominal surgery in the division of Surgical Oncology, Colorectal Surgery or Transplant Surgery. The MobiMD app provides push notification reminders directly to the patient's smart device, prompting them to enter clinical data and patient-reported outcomes. Clinical data collected via the MobiMD app include vital signs, red flag symptoms, daily wound and surgical drain images, ostomy output, drain output, medication compliance, and wound care compliance. These data are reviewed daily by a physician. The primary outcome is the proportion of participants readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of surgery. Secondary outcomes are 90-day hospital readmission, emergency department and urgent care visits, complication severity, and total readmission cost. Discussion: If effective, mobile health apps such as MobiMD could be routinely integrated into surgical transitional care programs to minimize unnecessary hospital readmissions, emergency department visits and healthcare resource utilization.

Research described some examples of interventions to increase and improve structured and standardized data, such as guidelines and policies, training and user friendly EHR interfaces. However, little is known about the translation of this knowledge into practical solutions. Our study aimed to specify the most effective and feasible interventions that enable better structured and standardized EHR data registration and described practical examples of successfully implemented interventions. Methods: A concept mapping approach was used to determine feasible interventions that were considered to be effective or have been successfully implemented in Dutch hospitals. A focus group was held with Chief Medical Information Officers and Chief Nursing Information Officers. After interventions were determined, multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis were performed to categorize sorted interventions using Groupwisdom™, an online tool for concept mapping. Results are presented as Go-Zone plots and cluster maps. Following, semi-structured interviews were conducted to describe practical examples of successful interventions. Results: Interventions were classified into seven clusters ranked from highest to lowest perceived effectiveness: (1) education on usefulness and need; (2) strategic and (3) tactical organizational policies; (4) national policy; (5) monitoring and adjusting data (6) structure of and support from the EHR and (7) support in the registration process (EHR independent).

Such devices, laden with clinical-grade sensors and cloud connectivity, allow clinicians, researchers, and patients to monitor health longitudinally, passively, and persistently, shifting the paradigm of care and research from low-resolution, intermittent, and discrete to one of persistent, continuous, and high resolution. The collection, transmission, and storage of sensitive health data using mobile devices presents unique challenges that serve as significant barriers to entry for care providers and researchers alike. Compliance with standards like HIPAA and GDPR requires unique skills and practices. These requirements make off-the-shelf technologies insufficient for use in the digital health space. As a result, budget, timeline, talent, and resource constraints are the largest barriers to new digital technologies. The CardinalKit platform is an open-source project addressing these challenges by focusing on reducing these barriers and accelerating the innovation, adoption, and use of digital health technologies. CardinalKit provides a mobile template application and web dashboard to enable an interoperable foundation for developing digital health applications. We demonstrate the applicability of CardinalKit to a wide variety of digital health applications across 18 innovative digital health prototypes.  © 2023 The Author(s).

Hence different approaches are needed. Approach Within the Viet Nam ICU Translational Applications Laboratory project, since 2018 we have been developing a wearable device for individual patient monitoring and a clinical assessment tool to improve dengue disease management. Working closely with local staff at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City, we developed and tested a prototype of the wearable device. We obtained perspectives on design and use of the sensor from patients. To develop the assessment tool, we used existing research data sets, mapped workflows and clinical priorities, interviewed stakeholders and held workshops with hospital staff. Local setting In Viet Nam, a lower middle-income country, the health-care system is in the nascent stage of implementing digital health technologies. Relevant changes Based on patient feedback, we are altering the design of the wearable sensor to increase comfort. We built the user interface of the assessment tool based on the core functionalities selected by workshop attendees. The interface was subsequently tested for usability in an iterative manner by the clinical staff members. Lessons learnt The development and implementation of digital health technologies need an interoperable and appropriate plan for data management including collection, sharing and integration. Engagements and implementation studies should be conceptualized and conducted alongside the digital health technology development. The priorities of end-users, and understanding context and regulatory landscape are crucial for success. © 2023, World Health Organization.

Family-directed, manually created visual depictions of care team composition (ie, care mapping) and detailed note-taking curated by caregivers (eg, care binders) have been shown to enhance care coordination for families of these children, but they are difficult to implement in clinical settings owing to a lack of integration with electronic health records and limited visibility of family-generated insights for care providers. Caremap is an electronic health record–integrated digital personal health record mobile app designed to integrate the benefits of care mapping and care binders. Currently, there is sparse literature describing end-user participation in the co-design of digital health tools. In this paper, we describe a project that evaluated the usability and proof of concept of the Caremap app through end-user simulation. Objective: This study aimed to conduct proof-of-concept testing of the Caremap app to coordinate care for children with special health care needs and explore early end-user engagement in simulation testing. The specific aims included engaging end users in app co-design via app simulation, evaluating the usability of the app using validated measures, and exploring user perspectives on how to make further improvements to the app. Methods: Caregivers of children with special health care needs were recruited to participate in a simulation exercise using Caremap to coordinate care for a simulated case of a child with complex medical and behavioral needs. Participants completed a postsimulation questionnaire adapted from 2 validated surveys: the Pediatric Integrated Care Survey (PICS) and the user version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale (uMARS). A key informant interview was also conducted with a liaison to Spanish-speaking families regarding app accessibility for non–English-speaking users. Results: A Caremap simulation was successfully developed in partnership with families of children with special health care needs. Overall, 38 families recruited from 19 different US states participated in the simulation exercise and completed the survey. The average rating for the survey adapted from the PICS was 4.1 (SD 0.82) out of 5, and the average rating for the adapted uMARS survey was 4 (SD 0.83) out of 5. The highest-rated app feature was the ability to track progress toward short-term, patient- and family-defined care goals. Conclusions: Internet-based simulation successfully facilitated end-user engagement and feedback for a digital health care coordination app for families of children with special health care needs. The families who completed simulation with Caremap rated it highly across several domains related to care coordination. The simulation study results elucidated key areas for improvement that translated into actionable next steps in app development. © The Author(s) 2023.",care coordination; co-design; complex care; digital health tools; family-centered design; mHealth; mobile health; participatory design; simulation; user-centered design,,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

Social determinants of health (SDoH) are widely recognized as a significant contributor to these disparities in health outcomes. Screening for social risk factors and referral for appropriate services is a critical step in addressing social needs and reducing outcome disparities. Methods We conducted interviews among employees (n = 18) and patients (n = 9) across three diverse, urban clinics within a healthcare system and one community-based organization involved in a five-year initiative to reduce maternal and infant disparities in DC. Interviews were guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to understand current processes and organizational factors that contributed to or impeded delivery of social risk factor screening and referral for indicated needs. Results We found that current processes for social risk factor screening and referral differed between and within clinics depending on the patient population. Key facilitators of successful screening included a supportive organizational culture and adaptability of more patient-centered screening processes. Key barriers to delivery included high patient volume and limited electronic health record capabilities to record results and track the status of internal and community referrals. Areas identified for improvement included additional social risk factor assessment training for new providers, patient-centered approaches to screening, improved tracking processes, and facilitation of connections to social services within clinical settings. Conclusion Despite proliferation of social risk factor screeners and recognition of their importance within health care settings, few studies detail implementation processes for social risk factor screening and referrals. Future studies should test implementation strategies for screening and referral services to address identified barriers to implementation.  © 2023 Brown et al.",,Child; Delivery of Health Care; District of Columbia; Family; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant Care; Mass Screening; Referral and Consultation; article; cell proliferation; clinical article; controlled study; District of Columbia; electronic health record; employee; facilitation; female; health care system; human; implementation science; infant; infant care; interview; organizational culture; patient referral; patient volume; qualitative research; risk assessment; risk factor; social work; child; District of Columbia; family; health care delivery; infant care; mass screening; patient referral,Public Library of Science,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

Objective: This study (1) evaluates the feasibility of an FHIR-enabled digital PHR app for CC for children and youth with special health care needs, (2) characterizes determinants of implementation, and (3) explores associations between adoption and patient- or family-reported outcomes. Methods: This nonrandomized, single-arm, prospective feasibility trial will test an FHIR-enabled digital PHR app’s use among families of children and youth with special health care needs in primary care settings. Key app features are FHIR-enabled access to structured data from the child’s medical record, families’ abilities to longitudinally track patient- or family-centered care goals, and sharing progress toward care goals with the child’s primary care provider via a clinician dashboard. We shall enroll 40 parents or caregivers of children and youth with special health care needs to use the app for 6 months. Inclusion criteria for children and youth with special health care needs are age 0-16 years; primary care at a participating site; complex needs benefiting from CC; high hospitalization risk in the next 6 months; English speaking; having requisite technology at home (internet access, Apple iOS mobile device); and an active web-based EHR patient portal account to which a parent or caregiver has full proxy access. Digital prescriptions will be used to disseminate study recruitment materials directly to eligible participants via their existing EHR patient portal accounts. We will apply an intervention mixed methods design to link quantitative and qualitative (semistructured interviews and family engagement panels with parents of children and youth with special health care needs) data and characterize implementation determinants. Two CC frameworks (Pediatric Care Coordination Framework; Patient-Centered Medical Home) and 2 evaluation frameworks (Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research; Technology Acceptance Model) provide theoretical foundations for this study. Results: Participant recruitment began in fall 2022, before which we identified >300 potentially eligible patients in EHR data. A family engagement panel in fall 2021 generated formative feedback from family partners. Integrated analysis of pretrial quantitative and qualitative data informed family-centered enhancements to study procedures. Conclusions: Our findings will inform how to integrate an FHIR-enabled digital PHR app for children and youth with special health care needs into clinical care. Mixed methods and implementation research will help strengthen implementation in diverse clinical settings. The study is positioned to advance knowledge of how to use digital health innovations for improving care and outcomes for children and youth with special health care needs and their families. © David Y Ming, Willis Wong, Kelley A Jones, Richard C Antonelli, Nitin Gujral, Sarah Gonzales, Ursula Rogers, William Ratliff, Nirmish Shah, Heather A King.",care coordination; children with special health care needs; digital health; mixed methods; mobile phone; personal health record,,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

Accommodating an extensive array of stakeholders, which includes patients, doctors, hospitals, and laboratories, demands interoperability to serve scalable services. FHIR frameworks have played a vital role in e-Healthcare designs. Most of the existing HL7-FHIR frameworks have used REST-API using HTTP-query for CRUD tasks that impose numerous rules and constraints, making the process more complex and time-consuming, violating the quality-of-service (QoS) standards on different levels. This paper develops a novel, robust Smart-Contract Authentication Assisted HL7-FHIR framework toward an interoperable e-Healthcare solution. Unlike classical REST API-based FHIR, our proposed method applies a Graph-mapping concept that transforms each resource variable into an equivalent Graph-Mapped Data Structure (GMS), which is subsequently stored in the NoSQL MongoDB database, reducing computational costs and time to meet QoS demands. The proposed model employs three key components, GMS-driven HL7 FHIR Gateway Model, Smart Contract Authentication and Client Model. The Smart Contract function helped verify and authenticate users to ensure privacy and secure EHR exchange. The assessment of the performance of the proposed model reveals a significant reduction in computational time with optimal resource utilization making it a significant and viable option to better the real-world e-Healthcare mechanisms. © 2023 The Authors",eHealthcare; FHIR; Graph-API; Interoperability; Smart contract; Telemedicine,,Elsevier Ltd,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

Materials and Methods: We used an open-source Bulk FHIR Testing Suite at 5 healthcare sites from April to September 2023, including 4 hospitals using electronic health records (EHRs) certified for interoperability, and 1 Health Information Exchange (HIE) using a custom, standards-compliant API build. We measured export speeds, data sizes, and completeness across 6 types of FHIR. Results: Among the certified platforms, Oracle Cerner led in speed, managing 5-16 million resources at over 8000 resources/min. Three Epic sites exported a FHIR data subset, achieving 1-12 million resources at 1555-2500 resources/min. Notably, the HIE’s custom API outperformed, generating over 141 million resources at 12 000 resources/min. Discussion: The HIE’s custom API showcased superior performance, endorsing the effectiveness of SMART/HL7 Bulk FHIR in enabling large-scale data exchange while underlining the need for optimization in existing EHR platforms. Agility and scalability are essential for diverse health, research, and public health use cases. Conclusion: To fully realize the interoperability goals of the 21st Century Cures Act, addressing the performance limitations of Bulk FHIR API is critical. It would be beneficial to include performance metrics in both certification and reporting processes. # The Author(s) 2024.

Understanding the accumulation of health information management (HIM) knowledge from the past to the present and building a new vision to meet this need reveals the importance of understanding the available scientific knowledge. With this research, it is aimed to examine the scientific documents of the last 40 years of HIM literature with a holistic approach using science mapping techniques and to guide future research. Methods: This study used a bibliometric analysis method for science mapping. Co-citation and co-occurrence document analyses were performed on 630 academic publications selected from the Web of Science core collection (WoSCC) database using the keyword “Health Information Management” and inclusion criteria. The analyses were performed using the R-based software Bibliometrix (Version 4.0; K-Synth Srl), Python (Version 3.12.1; The Python Software Foundation), and Microsoft® Excel® 2016. Results: Co-occurrence analyses revealed the themes of personal health records, clinical coding and data quality, and health information management. The HIM theme consisted of five subthemes: “electronic records”, “medical informatics”, “e-health and telemedicine”, “health education and awareness”, and “health information systems (HISs)”. As a result of the co-citation analysis, the prominent themes were technology acceptance, standardized clinical coding, the success of HISs, types of electronic records, people with HIM, health informatics used by consumers, e-health, e-mobile health technologies, and countries’ frameworks and standards for HISs. Conclusions: This comprehensive bibliometric study shows that structured information can be helpful in understanding research trends in HIM. This study identified critical issues in HIM, identified meaningful themes, and explained the topic from a holistic perspective for all health system actors and stakeholders who want to work in the field of HIM. © 2024 by the authors.",bibliometric analysis; electronic records; health information management,,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

Here, taking the perspective of technology as routine capability, we reframe the concept to incorporate not only distributed agency involved around devices, but also distributed agency concerned with use through associated routines. We argue that technology acquisition in the form of capabilities concerns use and that technology entrepreneurship typically entails substantial institutional work in the promotion of adoption and use. We illustrate this in the case of the long and painful history of the acquisition of electronic health records (EHR). Our reframing leads to new insights. Among these is the identification of what we term path convergence and its importance in the social acquisition of a technology. We argue that technology entrepreneurs must attend to this path convergence, or the technology may not be widely taken up. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Organizing vision; Path convergence; Routine capability; Technological change; Technology adoption; Technology entrepreneurship,,Elsevier Ltd,,,,Article,Final,

Use of these data sets and their associated knowledge are essential to understand the biological mechanisms behind diseases. While patients' clinical data from EHR can help researchers accurately and appropriately trace the performance of various kinds of medicines on the patients, the microarray data for the same pool of patients can contain valuable information for discovery of disease-associated gene expression patterns and can help classify the patients. However, research in the area of integrating genomic data with clinical data is still in its infancy and is riddled with many challenges. Even though data and knowledge sets are easily available from genome sequences and protein structural data of organisms, they usually are of many different varieties. Integrating them for a better understanding of biological functions at all levels is complicated. If we want to obtain the full benefit of functional genomics, we need to find a seamless way to integrate large amounts of patient datasets with genomic datasets in the field of biomedicine. Few papers in the decision support systems (DSS) literature provide an overview of Genomic Clinical Decision Support (GCDS) challenges that span data, knowledge, input/output, and architecture/implementation. This paper presents a unique effort dedicated to providing a comprehensive listing and a concise description of the DSS methodological challenges that arise from integrating complex and massive-scale genomic data with Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Clinical decision support; Data integration; Decision support system; Decision support system architecture; Genomics; Knowledge base integration,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Clinical research; Decision support systems; Gene expression; Knowledge based systems; Biological functions; Biological mechanisms; Clinical decision support; Decision support system (dss); Gene expression patterns; Genomics; Knowledge base; Large amounts of data; Data integration,Elsevier B.V.,,,,Article,Final,

Implementation-friendly formats for data representation and compliance to widely adopted industry standards are among the strengths of Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources that are accelerating its wide adoption. Research confirms the advantages of Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources in increasing data interoperability in mortality reporting, genetic test sharing, and patient-generated data. However, few studies have investigated the application of Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources in nursing-specific domains. In this study, a Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources document was generated for a use case scenario in a home-based, pressure ulcer care setting. Study goals were to describe the step-by-step process of generating a Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources artifact and to inform nursing communities about the advantages and challenges in representing nursing data with Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources. Overall, Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources effectively represented the majority of the data included in the use case scenario. A few challenges that could potentially cause information loss were noted such as the lack of standardized concept codes for value encoding and the difficulty directly connecting an observation to a related condition. Continuous evaluations in diverse nursing domains are needed in order to gain a more thorough insight on potential challenges that Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources holds in representing nursing data.

This article discusses the development and acceptability of a mobile application (app) that integrates with the electronic health record to facilitate screening for atrial fibrillation (AF). Methods: After app development and implementation, we compared workflows with and without the mobile app. Seven older adults used it during a prospective twice-daily 2-week home-based AF screening protocol and completed an acceptability survey with Likert scale responses. Results: Compliance with the screening protocol was 82%. Acceptability and usability was favorable. Patients reported confidence in the connection between the app and their medical record. Discussion: The availability of apps to capture data and facilitate a connection with health systems is critical. The app developed is a feasible solution for older patients with AF to self-monitor and report results to their health provider. © Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.",atrial fibrillation; electronic health record integration; implementation; m-health; screening; telehealth; telemedicine,Aged; Atrial Fibrillation; Humans; Mobile Applications; Prospective Studies; Research; Diagnosis; Diseases; Medical computing; mHealth; Records management; Telemedicine; Application development; Atrial fibrillation; Consumer devices; Electronic health record integration; Implementation; Mobile applications; Older adults; Screening protocol; Telehealth; Work-flows; aged; atrial fibrillation; human; mobile application; prospective study; research; Mobile computing,Mary Ann Liebert Inc.,,,,Article,Final,

The setting is a large acute hospital that is designing and building its own EHR. Well-designed EHRs create opportunities for continuous data collection, which can be used in clinical decision support rules to drive patient safety. Collected data can be exchanged across health care systems to support patients in all health care settings. Data can be used for research to prevent diseases and protect future populations. Objective: The aim of this study was to migrate a current EHR, with all relevant patient data, to the SNOMED-CT coding system to optimize clinical use and clinical decision support, facilitate data sharing across organizational boundaries for national programs, and enable remodeling of medical pathways. Methods: The study used qualitative and quantitative data to understand the successes and gaps in the project, clinician attitudes toward the new tool, and the future use of the tool. Results: The new coding system (tool) was well received and immediately widely used in all specialties. This resulted in increased, accurate, and clinically relevant data collection. Clinicians appreciated the increased depth and detail of the new coding, welcomed the potential for both data sharing and research, and provided extensive feedback for further development. Conclusions: Successful implementation of the new system aligned the University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust with national strategy and can be used as a blueprint for similar projects in other health care settings. © Tanya Pankhurst, Felicity Evison, Jolene Atia, Suzy Gallier, Jamie Coleman, Simon Ball, Deborah McKee, Steven Ryan, Ruth Black.",Clinical decision support; Clinical usability; Clinician led design; Clinician reported experience; Coding standards; Data sharing; Diagnoses; Electronic health record standards; Electronic health records; Health data exchange; Health data research; International classification of diseases version 10 (ICD-10); National health service blueprint; Patient diagnoses; Population health; Problem list; Research; Systematized Nomenclature Of Medicine–Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT); Use of electronic health data; User-led design,,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

As the number of requests for NGS genomic testing increases, substantial efforts have been made to deliver the testing results clearly and unambiguously. For the legitimacy of clinical NGS genomic testing, quality information from the process of producing genomic data should be included within the results. However, most reports provide insufficient quality information to confirm the reliability of genomic testing owing to the complexity of the NGS process. Objective: The goal of this study was to develop a Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)-based web app, NGS Quality Reporting (NGS-QR), to report and manage the quality of the information obtained from clinical NGS genomic tests. Methods: We defined data elements for the exchange of quality information from clinical NGS genomic tests, and profiled a FHIR genomic resource to enable information exchange in a standardized format. We then developed the FHIR-based web app and FHIR server to exchange quality information, along with statistical analysis tools implemented with the R Shiny server. Results: Approximately 1000 experimental data entries collected from the targeted sequencing pipeline CancerSCAN designed by Samsung Medical Center were used to validate implementation of the NGS-QR app using real-world data. The user can share the quality information of NGS genomic testing and verify the quality status of individual samples in the overall distribution. Conclusions: This study successfully demonstrated how quality information of clinical NGS genomic testing can be exchanged in a standardized format. As the demand for NGS genomic testing in clinical settings increases and genomic data accumulate, quality information can be used as reference material to improve the quality of testing. This app could also motivate laboratories to perform diagnostic tests to provide high-quality genomic data. © 2021 Donghyeong Seong, Sungwon Jung, Sungchul Bae, Jongsuk Chung, Dae-Soon Son, Byoung-Kee Yi.",Clinical massive parallel sequencing; Clinical NGS genomic testing; FHIR; Genomic reporting; Quality control,Delivery of Health Care; Electronic Health Records; Genomics; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Reproducibility of Results; Article; comparative study; data processing; data quality; electronic medical record; Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources; genetic profile; genome analysis; high throughput sequencing; human; medical information; mobile application; paraffin embedding; practice guideline; prognosis; quality control; total quality management; electronic health record; genomics; health care delivery; high throughput sequencing; reproducibility,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

Healthcare professionals and governments are encouraged to set administrative regulations and implement structured and interoperable representation to utilise the genetic/genomic data, which will support precision medicine approaches through Health Information Systems (HIS). Clear regulations and careful legislation are also crucial for the security and privacy of genetic/genomic test data. In this article, we present a review of the National Health Information System of Turkey (NHIS-T) about interoperable health data representation for genetic tests. We discuss the content of rules and regulations related to genetic/genomic testing and structured data representation in Turkey. A brief comparison of the Turkish “Law on the Protection of Personal Data” (LPPD) in genetic/genomic data privacy with its counterparts is presented. The final discussion about the shortcomings of Turkey is transferable to health information systems worldwide. Constructing a national reference database and IT infrastructure to enable data integration and exchange between genomic data, metadata, and health records will improve genetics studies’ utility and outcomes.

Clinical informatics tools could enhance provider adherence to echocardiogram guidelines for early detection of late-onset cardiomyopathy. METHODS Cancer registry data were linked to electronic health record data. Structured query language facilitated the construction of anthracycline-exposed cohorts at a single institution. Primary outcomes included the data quality from automatic anthracycline extraction, sensitivity of International Classification of Disease coding for heart failure, and adherence to echocardiogram guideline recommendations. RESULTS The final analytic cohort included 385 pediatric oncology patients diagnosed between July 1, 2013, and December 31, 2018, among whom 194 were classified as no anthracycline exposure, 143 had low anthracycline exposure (, 250 mg/m2), and 48 had high anthracycline exposure (≥ 250 mg/m2). Manual review of anthracycline exposure was highly concordant (95%) with the automatic extraction. Among the unexposed group, 15% had an anthracycline administered at an outside institution not captured by standard query language coding. Manual review of echocardiogram parameters and clinic notes yielded a sensitivity of 75%, specificity of 98%, and positive predictive value of 68% for International Classification of Disease coding of heart failure. For patients with anthracycline exposure, 78.5% (n = 62) were adherent to guideline recommendations for echocardiogram surveillance. There were significant association with provider adherence and race and ethnicity (P = .047), and 50% of patients with Spanish as their primary language were adherent compared with 90% of patients with English as their primary language (P = .003).

Graphical displays that integrate patient information can improve information processing, especially in data-rich environments such as critical care. We propose an adaptable and reusable approach to patient information display with modular graphical components (widgets). We had two study objectives. First, reduce numerous widget prototype alternatives to preferred designs. Second, derive widget design feature recommendations. Using iterative human-centered design methods, we interviewed experts to hone design features of widgets displaying frequently measured data elements, e.g., heart rate, for acute care patient monitoring and real-time clinical decision-making. Participant responses to design queries were coded to calculate feature-set agreement, average prototype score, and prototype agreement. Two iterative interview cycles covering 64 design queries and 86 prototypes were needed to reach consensus on six feature sets. Interviewers agreed that line graphs with a smoothed or averaged trendline, 24-h timeframe, and gradient coloring for urgency were useful and informative features. Moreover, users agreed that widgets should include key functions: (1) adjustable reference ranges, (2) expandable timeframes, and (3) access to details on demand. Participants stated graphical widgets would be used to identify correlating patterns and compare abnormal measures across related data elements at a specific time. Combining theoretical principles and validated design methods was an effective and reproducible approach to designing widgets for healthcare displays. The findings suggest our widget design features and recommendations match critical care clinician expectations for graphical information display of continuous and frequently updated patient data. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",Critical care; Data integration; Graphical display; Medical informatics applications; Participatory design,Critical Care; Data Display; Electronic Health Records; Heuristics; Humans; Decision making; Graph theory; Hospital data processing; Iterative methods; Patient monitoring; Clinical decision making; Electronic health record; Graphic displays; Graphical displays; Graphical information; Heuristic designs; Human-centered designs; Patient information; adult; article; clinical decision making; consensus; controlled study; data integration; emergency care; expectation; heart rate; human; interview; medical informatics; patient coding; patient monitoring; theoretical study; universal design; electronic health record; heuristics; information processing; intensive care; Design,Springer Science and Business Media B.V.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access

This paper presents a new approach, founded on evidence-based medical knowledge, using as much information and proof as possible to help a computer program to predict bladder cancer treatment side effects and support the oncologist’s decision. This will help in deciding treatment options for patients with bladder malignancies. Bladder cancer knowledge is complex and requires simplification before any attempt to represent it in a formal or computerized manner. In this work we rely on the capabilities of OWL ontologies to seamlessly capture and conceptualize the required knowledge about this type of cancer and the underlying patient treatment process. Our ontology allows case-based reasoning to effectively predict treatment side effects for a given set of contextual information related to a specific medical case. The ontology is enriched with proofs and evidence collected from online biomedical research databases using “web crawlers”. We have exclusively designed the crawler algorithm to search for the required knowledge based on a set of specified keywords. Results from the study presented 80.3% of real reported bladder cancer treatment side-effects prediction and were close to really occurring adverse events recorded within the collected test samples when applying the approach. Evidence-based medicine combined with semantic knowledge-based models is prominent in generating predictions related to possible health concerns. The integration of a diversity of knowledge and evidence into one single integrated knowledge-base could dramatically enhance the process of predicting treatment risks and side effects applied to bladder cancer oncotherapy. © 2021 by the authors.

The potential for information technology (IT) to support the service through data management, communication and national registration has been reported. However, no previous national-level evaluation on the current state of digital transformation has been undertaken. Methods: We undertook structured phone interviews with transplant coordinators at all 23 transplant centres in the United Kingdom (UK). The interview covered topics including clinical workflows during transplant referral and current data management processes. Based on established frameworks, we elicited IT capabilities, readiness and infrastructure to evaluate the digital maturity at each centre. We analysed interview data thematically and synthesised results across centres to identify common challenges and inform recommendations. Results: Transplant coordinators across centres reported similar care pathways with patients being referred by to transplant centres from regional renal referral centres. Analysis revealed that a key challenge revolved around the inability to access data across organisational boundaries. This resulted in dependence on postal or electronic mail to transfer clinical data, such as blood results or medication lists. Most centres had a hospital-wide electronic medical record, which was unable to meet the specific workflow requirements of transplantation. This was primarily because implemented solutions were unable to provide a single unified view of transplant-related data. As a result, transplant coordinators reported several workarounds to manage clinical data, such as paper folders, Excel© sheets and scanned files on hospital shared drives. Conclusions: Existing front-line IT solutions and wider infrastructure did not support the requirements of care pathways in renal transplantation. Digital transformation should focus on the need to surface patient data across organisational boundaries and provide specific views of data that complement the clinical workflow. This study highlights how regional interoperability remains a major priority to support multi-centre specialist services. © 2022 The Author(s)",,Digital storage; Hospitals; Information management; Interoperability; Medical computing; Metadata; 'current; Clinical data; Clinical workflow; Current data; Digital transformation; Interview study; National level; Organizational boundaries; Renal transplantation; United kingdom; adult; article; e-mail; electronic medical record; human; human tissue; information technology; interview; kidney transplantation; maturity; multicenter study; patient coding; patient referral; transplant coordinator; United Kingdom; workflow; Hospital data processing,Elsevier Ireland Ltd,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access

Materials and Methods: A dedicated expert group participating in the German Medical Informatics Initiative reviewed information contained in MolGen reports, determined the key elements, and formulated a dataset definition. HL7's Genomics Reporting Implementation Guide (IG) was adopted as a basis for the FHIR® specification which was subjected to a public ballot. In addition, elements in the MolGen dataset were mapped to the fields defined in ISO/TS 20428:2017 standard to evaluate compliance. Results: A core dataset of 76 data elements, clustered into 6 categories was created to represent all key information of German MolGen reports. Based on this, a FHIR specification with 16 profiles, 14 derived from HL7®'s Genomics Reporting IG and 2 additional profiles (of the FamilyMemberHistory and RiskAssessment resources), was developed. Five example resource bundles show how our adaptation of an international standard can be used to model MolGen report data that was requested following oncological or rare disease indications. Furthermore, the map of the MolGen report data elements to the fields defined by the ISO/TC 20428:2017 standard, confirmed the presence of the majority of required fields.

Methods: We used a technology implementation framework to conduct the preimplementation assessment via surveys and focus groups of students, residents, and faculty members. Using Likert scales, the survey assessed baseline knowledge and confidence in dental providers' antibiotic prescribing. The focus groups gathered information on existing workflows, resources, and needs for end users for our CDST. Results: Of 355 dental providers recruited to take the survey, 213 (60%) responded: 151 students, 27 residents, and 35 faculty. The average confidence in antibiotic prescribing decisions was 3.2 ± 1.0 on a scale of 1 to 5 (ie, moderate). Dental students were less confident about prescribing antibiotics than residents and faculty (P <.01). However, antibiotic prescribing knowledge was no different between dental students, residents, and faculty. The mean likelihood of prescribing an antibiotic when it was not needed was 2.7 ± 0.6 on a scale of 1 to 5 (unlikely to maybe) and was not meaningfully different across subgroups (P =.10). We had 10 participants across 3 focus groups: 7 students, 2 residents, and 1 faculty member. Four major themes emerged, which indicated that dentists: (1) make antibiotic prescribing decisions based on anecdotal experiences; (2) defer to physicians' recommendations; (3) have limited access to evidence-based resources; and (4) want CDST for antibiotic prescribing. Conclusions: Dentists' confidence in antibiotic prescribing increased by training level, but knowledge did not. Trainees and practicing dentists would benefit from a CDST to improve appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing.  © The Author(s), 2023.

Study design: We extracted data from all children born at ≥34 weeks of gestation within one health system between 2014 and 2017. After excluding implausible growth data with an algorithm created for childhood growth, we estimated pBMI, peak weight and length velocities, and the odds of obesity at 2 years, adjusted for race, sex, ethnicity, and birth weight, by the magnitude of peak weight velocity, peak length velocity, and pBMI. Results: Among 6425 children (41% White, 28% Black, 26% other race; 16% Hispanic ethnicity), mean pBMI was 17.9 kg/m2 (SD 1.5) and mean age at pBMI was 9.6 months (SD 2.7). Mean peak weight velocity was 949 g (SD 165) per 2 weeks, and the mean peak length velocity was 3.4 cm (SD 0.3) per 2 weeks. Children with obesity at 2 years (n = 931, 14.5%) were more likely to be Hispanic, had greater peak weight and peak length velocities, and had 2 kg/m2 greater magnitude of pBMI than children without obesity. For each unit increase in pBMI, children had more than 4 times greater odds of obesity at age 2 years.

The authors propose a decentralized architecture that combines FHIR archetypes, shape expressions, and personal online datastores (PODs) to tackle those issues as follows: FHIR archetypes are used to express the data, shape expressions are used to handle data structure and data access requests, and PODs are used to store information in a decentralized and safe manner that let the owner of the information stored to handle data access. The system allows the patient to store dental information from heterogeneous data sources transparently and respecting the patient’s right to autonomy and consent. In this paper, the authors develop this architecture proposal and discuss its relevance and feasibility in the area of dental health. © 2023 IGI Global.

This type of technique has been used for different types of implementations in scientific studies. A review of the research areas related to the use of transpilers allows the understanding of the direction in this branch of knowledge. The objective was to carry out an exhaustive and extended mapping of the usage and implementation of transpilers in research studies in the last 10 years. A systematic mapping review was carried out for answering the 5 research questions proposed. The PSALSAR method is used as a guide to the steps needed for the review. In total, from 1181 articles collected, 683 primary studies were selected, reviewed, and analyzed. Proposals from the industry were also analyzed. A new method for automatic data tabulation has been proposed for the mapping objective, using a relational database and SQL language. It was identified that the most common uses of transpilers are related to performance optimizations, parallel programming, embedded systems, compilers, testing, AI, graphics, and software development. In conclusion, it was possible to determine the extent and identification of research sub-areas and their impact on the usage of the transpilers. Future research could be considered about the usage of transpilers in transactional software, migration strategies for legacy systems, AI, math, multiplatform games and apps, automatic source code generation, and networking. © 2023 by the authors.",cross compiler; software architecture; source-to-source compiler; systematic literature review; transcompiler; transpiler,,MDPI,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

Despite prior attempts at curbing such overutilization, there remains opportunity for improvement using novel data-driven approaches. This study presents the development and early evaluation of a clinical decision support tool that uses a predictive model to help providers reduce low-yield, repetitive laboratory testing in hospitalized patients. Methods: We developed an EHR-embedded SMART on FHIR application that utilizes a laboratory test result prediction model based on historical laboratory data. A combination of semi-structured physician interviews, usability testing, and quantitative analysis on retrospective laboratory data were used to inform the tool's development and evaluate its acceptability and potential clinical impact. Key results: Physicians identified culture and lack of awareness of repeat orders as key drivers for overuse of inpatient blood testing. Users expressed an openness to a lab prediction model and 13/15 physicians believed the tool would alter their ordering practices. The application received a median System Usability Scale score of 75, corresponding to the 75th percentile of software tools. On average, physicians desired a prediction certainty of 85% before discontinuing a routine recurring laboratory order and a higher certainty of 90% before being alerted. Simulation on historical lab data indicates that filtering based on accepted thresholds could have reduced ∼22% of repeat chemistry panels. Conclusions: The use of a predictive algorithm as a means to calculate the utility of a diagnostic test is a promising paradigm for curbing laboratory test overutilization. An EHR-embedded clinical decision support tool employing such a model is a novel and acceptable intervention with the potential to reduce low-yield, repetitive laboratory testing. © 2023 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists",Clinical decision support; Healthcare utilization; Laboratory information systems; Laboratory testing; Prediction algorithms,"Computer Simulation; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Physicians; Retrospective Studies; Software; Article; blood examination; clinical decision support system; controlled study; electronic health record; Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources; hospital patient; human; laboratory test; medical decision making; medical order; physician; physician attitude; predictive model; quantitative analysis; semi structured interview; total quality management; usability testing; computer simulation; electronic health record; physician; retrospective study; software",Elsevier Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access

To address this, we identify opioid prescription and opioid consumption as promising targets for adaptive interventions and present a design framework. Materials and Methods: Using the framework, we designed Smart Prescription Management (SPM) and Smart Consumption Monitoring (SCM) interventions. The interventions are evaluated using analytical modeling and secondary data on doctor shopping, opioid overdose, prescription quality, and cost components. Results: SPM was most effective (30-90% improvement, for example, prescriptions reduced from 18 to 1.8 per patient) for extensive doctor shopping and reduced overdose events and mortality. Opioid adherence was improved and the likelihood of addiction declined (10-30%) as the response rate to SCM was increased. There is the potential for significant incentives ($2267-$3237) to be offered for addressing severe OUD. Discussion: The framework and designed interventions adapt to changing needs and conditions of the patients to become an important part of global efforts in preventing OUD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper on adaptive interventions for preventing OUD by addressing both prescription and consumption. Conclusion: SPM and SCM improved opioid prescription and consumption while reducing the risk of opioid addiction. These interventions will assist in better prescription decisions and in managing opioid consumption leading to desirable outcomes. The interventions can be extended to other substance use disorders and to study complex scenarios of prescription and nonprescription opioids in clinical studies.  © 2022 The Author(s).

In this study, we propose an ostensive information architecture for healthcare information systems to decrease ambiguity caused by using signs in different contexts for different purposes. The ostensive information architecture adopts a consensus-based approach initiated from the perspective of information systems re-design and can be applied to other domains where information exchange is required between heterogeneous systems. Driven by the issues in FHIR (Fast Health Interoperability Resources) implementation, an ostensive approach that supplements the current lexical approach in semantic exchange is proposed. A Semantic Engine with an FHIR knowledge graph as the core is constructed using Neo4j to provide semantic interpretation and examples. The MIMIC III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) datasets and diabetes datasets have been employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed information architecture. We further discuss the benefits of the separation of semantic interpretation and data storage from the perspective of information system design, and the semantic reasoning towards patient-centric care underpinned by the Semantic Engine. © 2023, The Author(s).",Digital healthcare; FHIR; Graph database; Healthcare information systems; Knowledge graph; Ontology graph; Ostensive approach; Semantic interoperability,Data integration; Digital storage; Engines; Health care; Information dissemination; Information management; Information use; Knowledge graph; Medical computing; Medical information systems; Semantics; Digital healthcare; Fast health interoperability resource; Graph database; Healthcare information system; Information architectures; Knowledge graphs; Ontology graphs; Ostensive approach; Semantic interoperability; Semantic interpretation; Interoperability,Springer,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access

Standard user-centered design methods include focus groups and participatory design sessions with individual stakeholders, which generally limit user involvement to a small number of individuals due to the significant time investments from designers and end users. Objectives: The goal of this project was to reduce the effort for end users to participate in co-design of a software user interface by developing an interactive web-based crowdsourcing platform. Methods: In a randomized trial, we compared a new web-based crowdsourcing platform to standard participatory design ses - sions. We developed an interactive, modular platform that allows responsive remote customization and design feedback on a visual user interface based on user preferences. The responsive canvas is a dynamic HTML template that responds in real time to user preference selections. Upon completion, the design team can view the user’s interface creations through an administrator portal and download the structured selections through a REDCap interface. Results: We have created a software platform that allows users to customize a user interface and see the results of that customization in real time, receiving immediate feedback on the impact of their design choices. Neonatal clinicians used the new platform to successfully design and customize a neonatal handoff tool. They received no specific instruction and yet were able to use the software easily and reported high usability. Conclusions: VandAID, a new web-based crowdsourcing platform, can involve multiple users in user-centered design simultaneously and provides means of obtaining design feedback remotely. The software can provide design feedback at any stage in the design process, but it will be of greatest utility for specifying user requirements and evaluating iterative designs with multiple options. © Schattauer 2017.",Computers; Human factors and engineering; Human-computer interface; Informatics,Crowdsourcing; Humans; Internet; Software; User-Computer Interface; comparative study; computer interface; crowdsourcing; human; Internet; software,Schattauer GmbH,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access

The article implements a method to evaluate the preliminary content overlap of proprietary medical formats, including national terminologies and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)-international medical standard. Methods Three types of mappings were evaluated in the article: Proprietary format matched to FHIR, national terminologies matched to the FHIR mappings, and concepts from national terminologies matched to Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT). We matched attributes of the formats with FHIR definitions and calculated content overlap. Results The article reports the results of a manual mapping between a proprietary medical format and the FHIR standard. The following results were obtained: 81% of content overlap for the proprietary format to FHIR mapping, 88% of content overlap for the national terminologies to FHIR mapping, and 98.6% of concepts matching can be reached from national terminologies to SNOMED CT mapping. Twenty tables from the proprietary format and 20 dictionaries were matched with FHIR resources; nine dictionaries were matched with SNOMED CT concepts. Conclusion Mapping medical formats is a challenge. The obtained overlaps are promising in comparison with the investigated results. The study showed that standardization of data exchange between proprietary formats and FHIR is possible in Russia, and national terminologies can be used in FHIR-based information systems. © 2019 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart • New York.",content overlap; FHIR; mapping; medical records; proprietary format; SNOMED CT; terminology mapping,Dictionaries as Topic; Health Information Interoperability; Russia; Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine; article; Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources; information system; medical record; nomenclature; Russian Federation; Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine; book; data interoperability,Georg Thieme Verlag,,,,Article,Final,

Given the widespread utilization of EHRs and the emergence of third-party apps in EHR marketplaces, it has become necessary to conduct a systematic review and analysis of apps in EHR app marketplaces. Objective: The goal of this review is to organize, categorize, and characterize the availability of third-party apps in EHR marketplaces. Methods: Two informaticists (authors JR and BW) used grounded theory principles to review and categorize EHR apps listed in top EHR vendors' public-facing marketplaces. Results: We categorized a total of 471 EHR apps into a taxonomy consisting of 3 primary categories, 15 secondary categories, and 55 tertiary categories. The three primary categories were administrative (n=203, 43.1%), provider support (n=159, 33.8%), and patient care (n=109, 23.1%). Within administrative apps, we split the apps into four secondary categories: Front office (n=77, 37.9%), financial (n=53, 26.1%), office administration (n=49, 24.1%), and office device integration (n=17, 8.4%). Within the provider support primary classification, we split the apps into eight secondary categories: Documentation (n=34, 21.3%), records management (n=27, 17.0%), care coordination (n=23, 14.4%), population health (n=18, 11.3%), EHR efficiency (n=16, 10.1%), ordering and prescribing (n=15, 9.4%), medical device integration (n=13, 8.2%), and specialty EHR (n=12, 7.5%). Within the patient care primary classification, we split the apps into three secondary categories: Patient engagement (n=50, 45.9%), clinical decision support (n=40, 36.7%), and remote care (n=18, 16.5%). Total app counts varied substantially across EHR vendors. Overall, the distribution of apps across primary categories were relatively similar, with a few exceptions. Conclusions: We characterized and organized a diverse and rich set of third-party EHR apps. This work provides an important reference for developers, researchers, and EHR customers to more easily search, review, and compare apps in EHR app marketplaces.  © 2020 Jordon Ritchie, Brandon Welch.",App marketplace; Apps; Electronic health records; Interoperability; Medical informatics; Software,,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access
312,Ndlovu K.; Mars M.; Scott R.E.,Development of a conceptual framework for linking mHealth applications to eRecord systems in Botswana,2021,BMC Health Services Research,4.0,10.1186/s12913-021-07134-4,"Background: The proliferation of mHealth solutions and eRecord systems is inevitable in developing countries, and ensuring their bi-directional interoperability is essential. Interoperability has been described as the ability for two or more systems or components to exchange information and use the information that has been exchanged. Given the importance of linking mHealth solutions to eRecord systems in the developing world, a suitable interoperability framework is required to provide an agreed approach to interoperability and specify common elements. Although eHealth interoperability frameworks exist in the literature, none meet all the requirements for linking mHealth solutions to eRecord systems in developing countries. The aim of this paper was to describe the design and development of a conceptual framework for linking mHealth solutions to eRecord systems in Botswana, as an exemplar. Methods: An iterative and reflective process was adopted, supported by existing literature and research including consultations with eHealth experts, and guidance from existing frameworks. These collectively identified key elements, concepts, and standards relevant and essential for framework design and development. Results: The mHealth-eRecord Interoperability Framework (mHeRIF) was developed which highlights the need for: governance and regulation of mHealth and eRecord systems, a national health information exchange, and which interoperability levels to achieve. Each of these are supported by integral themes and concepts. It also addresses the need for regular review, accreditation, and alignment of framework concepts and themes with a National eHealth Strategy Interoperability Development Process. To demonstrate the framework’s applicability, a proposed architecture for the Kgonafalo mobile telemedicine programme is presented. Conclusion: Interoperable mHealth solutions and eRecords systems have the potential to strengthen health systems. This paper reports the design and development of an evidence-based mHeRIF to align with, build upon, and expand National eHealth Strategies by guiding the linking of mHealth solutions to eRecord systems in Botswana and other developing countries facing similar circumstances. © 2021, The Author(s).",Botswana; Developing countries; eRecord systems; Interoperability architecture; Interoperability framework; mHealth; OpenHIE; OpenHIM,Botswana; Humans; Telemedicine; accreditation; article; Botswana; conceptual framework; consultation; developing country; human; public health; telemedicine; Botswana; telemedicine,BioMed Central Ltd,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

Previously, we had developed a machine learning (ML) model based on Taiwan's local databases (TLD) to address this issue. However, the international transferability of this model is unclear. Objective: This study examines the international transferability of a machine learning model for detecting medication errors and whether the federated learning approach could further improve the accuracy of the model. Methods: The study cohort included 667,572 outpatient prescriptions from 2 large US academic medical centers. Our ML model was applied to build the original model (O model), the local model (L model), and the hybrid model (H model). The O model was built using the data of 1.34 billion outpatient prescriptions from TLD. A validation set with 8.98% (60,000/667,572) of the prescriptions was first randomly sampled, and the remaining 91.02% (607,572/667,572) of the prescriptions served as the local training set for the L model. With a federated learning approach, the H model used the association values with a higher frequency of co-occurrence among the O and L models. A testing set with 600 prescriptions was classified as substantiated and unsubstantiated by 2 independent physician reviewers and was then used to assess model performance. Results: The interrater agreement was significant in terms of classifying prescriptions as substantiated and unsubstantiated (κ=0.91; 95% CI 0.88 to 0.95). With thresholds ranging from 0.5 to 1.5, the alert accuracy ranged from 75%-78% for the O model, 76%-78% for the L model, and 79%-85% for the H model. Conclusions: Our ML model has good international transferability among US hospital data. Using the federated learning approach with local hospital data could further improve the accuracy of the model. © Yen Po Harvey Chin, Wenyu Song, Chia En Lien, Chang Ho Yoon, Wei-Chen Wang, Jennifer Liu, Phung Anh Nguyen, Yi Ting Feng, Li Zhou, Yu Chuan Jack Li, David Westfall Bates.

International standard organizations have developedstandards, approaches, and models to improve and implement semantic interoperability. The openEHR approach-one of thestandout semantic interoperability approaches-has been implemented worldwide to improve semantic interoperability based onreused archetypes.Objective: This study aimed to verify the feasibility of implementing semantic interoperability in different countries by comparingthe openEHR-based information models of 2 acute coronary syndrome (ACS) registries from China and New Zealand.Methods: A semantic archetype comparison method was proposed to determine the semantics reuse degree of reused archetypesin 2 ACS-related clinical registries from 2 countries. This method involved (1) determining the scope of reused archetypes; (2)identifying corresponding data items within corresponding archetypes; (3) comparing the semantics of corresponding data items;and (4) calculating the number of mappings in corresponding data items and analyzing results.Results: Among the related archetypes in the two ACS-related, openEHR-based clinical registries from China and New Zealand,there were 8 pairs of reusable archetypes, which included 89 pairs of corresponding data items and 120 noncorresponding dataitems. Of the 89 corresponding data item pairs, 87 pairs (98%) were mappable and therefore supported semantic interoperability,and 71 pairs (80%) were labeled as ""direct mapping"" data items. Of the 120 noncorresponding data items, 114 (95%) data itemswere generated via archetype evolution, and 6 (5%) data items were generated via archetype localization.Conclusions: The results of the semantic comparison between the two ACS-related clinical registries prove the feasibility ofestablishing the semantic interoperability of health care data from different countries based on the openEHR approach. Archetypereuse provides data on the degree to which semantic interoperability exists when using the openEHR approach. Although theopenEHR community has effectively promoted archetype reuse and semantic interoperability by providing archetype modelingmethods, tools, model repositories, and archetype design patterns, the uncontrolled evolution of archetypes and inconsistentlocalization have resulted in major challenges for achieving higher levels of semantic interoperability. © 2021.

Patient portals provide an effective method for secure communication between patients or their proxies and their health care providers. With greater acceptability of patient portals in private practices, patients have a unique opportunity to manage their health care needs. However, studies have shown that less than 50% of patients reported accessing the electronic health record (EHR) in a 12-month period. We used HINTS 5 cycle 1 and cycle 2 to assess disparities among US residents 18 and older with any chronic condition regarding the use of EHR for secure direct messaging with providers, to request refills, to make clinical decisions, or to share medical records with another provider. The results indicate that respondents with multimorbidity are more likely to share their medical records with other providers. However, respondents who are 75 and older are less likely to share their medical records with another provider. Additionally, respondents who are 65 and older are less likely to use the EHR for secure direct messaging with their provider. Additional health care strategies and provider communication should be developed to encourage older patients with chronic conditions to leverage the use of patient portals for effective disease management. © 2021 by the authors.

Materials and Methods: We developed a systematic and transparent process using publicly available tools (eGLIA, GEM Cutter, VSAC, and the CDS Authoring Tool) to translate an evidence-based clinical pathway (CP) into a Clinical Quality Language (CQL)-encoded CDS artifact. Results: We produced a 4-phase process for translating a CP into a CQL-based CDS artifact. CP content was extracted using GEM into discrete clinical concepts, encoded using standard terminologies into value sets on VSAC, evaluated against workflows using a wireframe, and finally structured as a computer readable CDS artifact using CQL. This process included a quality control step and intermediate products to support transparency and reuse by other CDS developers. Discussion: Translating a CP into a shareable, computer-readable CDS artifact was accomplished through a systematic process. Our process identified areas of ambiguity and gaps in the CP, which generated improvements in the CP. Collaboration with clinical subject experts and the CP development team was essential for translation. Publicly available tools were sufficient to support most translation steps, but expression of certain complex concepts required manual encoding. Conclusion: Standardized development of CDS from a CP is feasible using a systematic 4-phase process. CPs represent a potential reservoir for developers of evidence-based CDS.

Interdisciplinary research platforms that incorporate digital health to optimize cardiovascular health and wellness in cancer survivors are therefore needed as we advance in the digital era. Our goal was to develop the Connected Health Innovation Research Program (C.H.I.R.P.) to serve as a foundation for future integration and assessments of adoption and clinical efficacy of digital health tools for cardiovascular health and wellness in the general population and in oncology patients. Design/setting/participants: Partner companies were identified through the American Medical Association innovation platform, as well as LinkedIn and direct contact by our team. Company leaders met with our team to discuss features of their technology or software. Non-disclosure agreements were signed and data were discussed and obtained for descriptive or statistical analysis. Results: A suite of companies with technologies focused on wellness, biometrics tracking, audio companions, oxygen saturation, weight trends, sleep patterns, heart rate variability, electrocardiogram patterns, blood pressure patterns, real-time metabolism tracking, instructional video modules, or integration of these technologies into electronic health records was collated. We formed an interdisciplinary research team and established an academia-industry collaborative foundation for connecting patients with wellness digital health technologies. Conclusions: A suite of software and device technologies accessible to the cardiology and oncology population has been established and will facilitate retrospective, prospective, and case research studies assessing adoption and clinical efficacy of digital health tools in cardiology/oncology. © 2022",Cardio-oncology; Connected health; Digital health; Digital transformation; Innovation; Learning Health System,,Elsevier Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

Patient portals that are accessible through electronic health records may offer improved patient-provider communication and better medication management in patients with diabetes and uncontrolled hypertension. We conducted a prospective, mixed-methods evaluation of the Duke PillBox application, a SMART-on-FHIR medication management application integrated into the electronic health record patient portal. Adults with active portal status, diabetes, and uncontrolled hypertension participated in a usability/feasibility survey and communicated with a pharmacist via the portal-based application who conducted medication reconciliation and discussed medication indications, side effects, and barriers to use with patients. Of the eligible patients (n = 285), 29 (10%) were interested, and 12 (8%) participated. Challenges to usability were due to the electronic health record-portal communication interface (91%), browser access and compatibility (55%), and persistent lists of unused medications in the electronic health record (27%). The findings of this study suggest that electronic health record-integrated medication applications are desirable as indicated in patient interactions at the outset and conclusion of the study. Persistent challenges included electronic health record integration, interoperability, user interface, and browser connectivity for both patients and providers.  © 2021 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Communication; Diabetes; Digital apps; Electronic health record; Hypertension; Interoperability; Medication management,Adult; Communication; Diabetes Mellitus; Electronic Health Records; Feasibility Studies; Humans; Hypertension; Medication Therapy Management; Prospective Studies; adult; diabetes mellitus; electronic health record; feasibility study; human; hypertension; interpersonal communication; medication therapy management; prospective study,Lippincott Williams and Wilkins,,,,Article,Final,

According to the Financial Supervisory Service, the share of the population with PIHI increased to 66% in 2018 due to the financial burden. However, since the traditional PIHI claim workflow is based on the paper attachment method, it is a big burden to every stakeholder and limits the usability and accessibility of the claims data. To improve the traditional PIHI claim workflow, we developed the electronic claim (eClaim) service for the PIHI in Korea. We also applied the HL7® (Health Level Seven) FHIR® (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard to ensure interoperability of the claims data. The proposed eClaim Service has been launched in 2017. It has been increased from 8155 in the first half of 2018 to 114,087 in the second half of 2020. Currently, 60 healthcare providers and 22 payers participated in this service. In this study, we proposed an eClaim workflow and service to improve the legacy system.

Care of other complex conditions has benefited from digital health solutions that efficiently integrate disparate clinical information. Although various digital approaches have been developed for research and care in PD, no digital solution to personalize and improve communication in a clinical encounter is readily available. Objective: We intend to improve the efficacy and efficiency of clinical encounters with people with PD through the development of a platform (PD-BRIDGE) with personalized clinical information from the electronic health record (EHR) and patient-reported outcome (PRO) data. Methods: Using human-centered design (HCD) processes, we engaged clinician and patient stakeholders in developing PD-BRIDGE through three phases: an inspiration phase involving focus groups and discussions with people having PD, an ideation phase generating preliminary mock-ups for feedback, and an implementation phase testing the platform. To qualitatively evaluate the platform, movement disorders neurologists and people with PD were sent questionnaires asking about the technical validity, usability, and clinical relevance of PD-BRIDGE after their encounter. Results: The HCD process led to a platform with 4 modules. Among these, 3 modules that pulled data from the EHR include a longitudinal module showing motor ratings over time, a display module showing the most recently collected clinical rating scales, and another display module showing relevant laboratory values and diagnoses; the fourth module displays motor symptom fluctuation based on an at-home diary. In the implementation phase, PD-BRIDGE was used in 17 clinical encounters for patients cared for by 1 of 11 movement disorders neurologists. Most patients felt that PD-BRIDGE facilitated communication with their clinician (n=14, 83%) and helped them understand their disease trajectory (n=11, 65%) and their clinician’s recommendations (n=11, 65%). Neurologists felt that PD-BRIDGE improved their ability to understand the patients’ disease course (n=13, 75% of encounters), supported clinical care recommendations (n=15, 87%), and helped them communicate with their patients (n=14, 81%). In terms of improvements, neurologists noted that data in PD-BRIDGE were not exhaustive in 62% (n=11) of the encounters. Conclusions: Integrating clinically relevant information from EHR and PRO data into a visually efficient platform (PD-BRIDGE) can facilitate clinical encounters with people with PD. Developing new modules with more disparate information could improve these complex encounters even further. ©Ethan G Brown, Erica Schleimer, Ian O Bledsoe, William Rowles, Nicolette A Miller, Stephan J Sanders, Katherine P Rankin, Jill L Ostrem, Caroline M Tanner, Riley Bove.",Digital health; Human-centered design; Parkinson disease; Personal health record; Visualization in eHealth,,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

However, most mHealth apps do not use accessible language. Standardized terminologies have potential to solve this problem but have not been simplified for consumer use. Methods: We used a standardized health terminology, the Omaha System, as the framework to develop the Simplified Omaha System Terms (SOST) for use within a mHealth application, MyStrengths + MyHealth. Plain language principles informed the SOST development in three phases, a community-validation focus group enabled feedback from diverse end-users, a readability assessment provide validation to the desired goal readability level. Results: The community-validation members (n = 19) ages ranged from 22 to 74; 51% male, 84% people of color, and 21% college educated. The reading level of the final SOST averaged 3.86 on the Coleman–Liau Index (fourth grade). A case study showed meaningful whole-person health data were generated in a community-led study during COVID-19. Conclusions: Community validation and readability assessment demonstrated accessible language for a clinical terminology. The SOST was deployed successfully in MyStrengths + My Health and in a community-led study. The Omaha System as a framework for the SOST may enable the data to be integrated with clinical datasets.

A large-scale, hospital-wide implementation of a clinical mobile app for health care professionals developed in partnership with Google Health and academic partners was deployed on a bring-your-own-device basis using mobile device management at our UK academic hospital. As this was the first large-scale implementation of this type of innovation in the UK health system, important insights and lessons learned from the deployment may be useful to other organizations considering implementing similar technology in partnership with commercial companies. Objective: The aims of this study are to define the key enablers and barriers and to propose a road map for the implementation of a hospital-wide clinical mobile app developed in collaboration with an industry partner as a data processor and an academic partner for independent evaluation. Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted with high-level stakeholders from industry, academia, and health care providers who had instrumental roles in the implementation of the app at our hospital. The interviews explored the participants’ views on the enablers and barriers to the implementation process. The interviews were analyzed using a broadly deductive approach to thematic analysis. Results: In total, 14 participants were interviewed. Key enablers identified were the establishment of a steering committee with high-level clinical involvement, well-defined roles and responsibilities between partners, effective communication strategies with end users, safe information governance precautions, and increased patient engagement and transparency. Barriers identified were the lack of dedicated resources for mobile change at our hospital, risk aversion, unclear strategy and regulation, and the implications of bring-your-own-device and mobile device management policies. The key lessons learned from the deployment process were highlighted, and a road map for the implementation of large-scale clinical mobile apps in hospital settings was proposed. Conclusions: Despite partnering with one of the world’s biggest technology companies, the cultural and technological change required for mobile working and implementation in health care was found to be a significant challenge. With an increasing requirement for health care organizations to partner with industry for advanced mobile technologies, the lessons learned from our implementation can influence how other health care organizations undertake a similar mobile change and improve the chances of successful widespread mobile transformation. ©Ravi Aggarwal, Sheena Visram, Guy Martin, Viknesh Sounderajah, Sanjay Gautama, Kevin Jarrold, Robert Klaber, Shona Maxwell, John Neal, Jack Pegg, Julian Redhead, Dominic King, Hutan Ashrafian, Ara Darzi.",Clinical applications; Health care industry; Implementation science; MHealth; Mobile apps; Mobile phone; Mobile technology; Smartphone apps; Stakeholders,Delivery of Health Care; Health Personnel; Humans; Mobile Applications; Qualitative Research; Tertiary Care Centers; health care delivery; health care personnel; human; mobile application; qualitative research; tertiary care center,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

We engaged caregivers of children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), adults with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and clinicians in a pilot study to assess their experiences and the utility and impact of an electronic previsit questionnaire and point-of-care dashboard to support coproduction of rheumatology care. Methods: We employed a mixed-methods design to assess users’ perceptions of a customized electronic health record rheumatology module at four pediatric rheumatology practices and two adult rheumatology practices. We surveyed a convenience sample of caregivers of children with JIA (n = 113), adults with RA (n = 116), and clinicians (n = 12). We conducted semistructured interviews with 13 caregivers and patients and six care teams. Experiences were evaluated using descriptive statistics and thematic analyses. Results: Caregivers of children with JIA and adults with RA reported the dashboards were useful during discussions (88%) and helped them talk about what mattered most (82%), make health care decisions (83%), and create a treatment plan (77%). Clinicians provided similar feedback. Two-thirds (67%) of caregivers and adults and 55% of clinicians would recommend the dashboard to peers. System usability scores (77.1 ± 15.6) were above average. Dashboards helped users make sense of health information, communicate more effectively, and make decisions. Improvements to the dashboards and workflows could enhance patient self-management and clinician efficiency. Conclusion: Visual point-of-care dashboards can support caregivers, patients, and clinicians to coproduce rheumatology care.

Algorithms trained on a particular task, based on specific data formats available in a set of medical records, tend to not generalize well to other tasks or databases in which the data fields may differ. To address this challenge, we propose General Healthcare Predictive Framework (GenHPF), which is applicable to any EHR with minimal preprocessing for multiple prediction tasks. GenHPF resolves heterogeneity in medical codes and schemas by converting EHRs into a hierarchical textual representation while incorporating as many features as possible. To evaluate the efficacy of GenHPF, we conduct multi-task learning experiments with single-source and multi-source settings, on three publicly available EHR datasets with different schemas for 12 clinically meaningful prediction tasks. Our framework significantly outperforms baseline models that utilize domain knowledge in multi-source learning, improving average AUROC by 1.2%P in pooled learning and 2.6%P in transfer learning while also showing comparable results when trained on a single EHR dataset. Furthermore, we demonstrate that self-supervised pretraining using multi-source datasets is effective when combined with GenHPF, resulting in a 0.6%P AUROC improvement compared to models without pretraining. By eliminating the need for preprocessing and feature engineering, we believe that this work offers a solid framework for multi-task and multi-source learning that can be leveraged to speed up the scaling and usage of predictive algorithms in healthcare.  © 2013 IEEE.",Electronic health records; heterogeneity; multi-source learning; multi-task learning; natural language process,Diagnosis; Domain Knowledge; E-learning; Health care; Job analysis; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Natural language processing systems; Code; Electronic health; Electronic health record; Health records; Heterogeneity; Medical diagnostic imaging; Multi-source learning; Multi-Sources; Multitask learning; Natural language process; Predictive models; Task analysis; adult; algorithm; article; controlled study; data base; diagnostic imaging; electronic health record; human; human experiment; learning; medical record; normal human; prediction; predictive model; transfer of learning; Learning algorithms,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access

Results Main lessons learned include the importance of detailed preparation of organisational requirements/specifications and organisational 'readiness'. Early staff involvement, resulting in ownership of the selected system by the organisation was a key achievement. The scoring process used required significant resource commitment but, despite being extensive in scope, provided relatively poor distinction between suppliers, despite significant variation in supplier self-scoring. Other elements, such as demonstrations and site visits, provided superior evaluation of functional abilities, and specification requirements should be regarded as threshold evaluation.

In an effort to reduce the cost and manual effort involved in the screening process, several studies have leveraged electronic health records (EHR) to refine cohorts to better match the eligibility criteria, which is referred to as phenotyping. We extend this approach to dynamically identify a cohort by repeating phenotyping in alternation with manual screening. Methods: Our approach consists of multiple screen cycles. At the start of each cycle, the phenotyping algorithm is used to identify eligible patients from the EHR, creating an ordered list such that patients that are most likely eligible are listed first. This list is then manually screened, and the results are analyzed to improve the phenotyping for the next cycle. We describe the preliminary results and challenges in the implementation of this approach for an intervention study on heart failure. Results: A total of 1,022 patients were screened, with 223 (23%) of patients being found eligible for enrollment into the intervention study. The iterative approach improved the phenotyping in each screening cycle. Without an iterative approach, the positive screening rate (PSR) was expected to dip below the 20% measured in the first cycle; however, the cyclical approach increased the PSR to 23%. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that dynamic phenotyping can facilitate recruitment for prospective clinical study. Future directions include improved informatics infrastructure and governance policies to enable real-time updates to research repositories, tooling for EHR annotation, and methodologies to reduce human annotation. © 2019, Journal of Clinical Medicine Research.

Pursuing such customizations, however, is not without risk. Validating the expected behavior of a customized CDS system in the high-volume, complex environment of the live EHR is a challenging problem. Objective This article identifies technology failures that impacted clinical care related to web service-based advanced custom CDS systems embedded in the complex sociotechnical context of a production EHR. Methods In an academic health system's primary care network, we performed an inventory of incidents between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2016 related to a customized CDS system and performed a targeted review of changes in the CDS source code. Additional feedback on the root cause of individual incidents was obtained through interviews with members of the CDS project teams. Results We identified five CDS malfunctions that impaired clinical workflow. The mechanisms for these failures are mapped to four characteristics of well-behaved applications: (1) system integrity; (2) data integrity; (3) reliability; and (4) scalability. Over the 9-year period, two malfunctions of the customized CDS significantly impaired clinical workflow for a total of 5 hours. Lesser impacts-loss of individual features with straightforward workarounds-arose from three malfunctions, which affected users on 53 days. Discussion Advanced customization of EHRs for the purpose of CDS can present significant risks to clinical workflow. Conclusion This case study highlights that advanced customization of CDS within a commercial EHR may support care for complex patient populations, but ongoing monitoring and support is required to ensure its safe use. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG, Stuttgart.

Genetic sequence test results are typically communicated by the molecular laboratory and stored in the EHR as textual documents. Although text documents are useful for human readability and initial use, they are not conducive for data retrieval and reuse. As a result, clinicians often struggle to find historical gene sequence results on a series of oncology patients within the EHR that might influence the care of the current patient. Second, identification of patients with specific mutation results in the EHR who are now eligible for new and/or changing therapy is not easily accomplished. Third, the molecular laboratory is challenged to monitor its sequencing processes for nonrandom process variation and other quality metrics. A novel approach to address each of these issues is presented and demonstrated. The authors use standard Health Level 7 laboratory result message formats in conjunction with international standards, Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms and Human Genome Variant Society nomenclature, to represent, communicate, and store discrete gene sequence data within the EHR in a scalable fashion.

However, most research on quality improvement and safety interventions in EHRs is still conducted at a single site, in a single EHR. Although single-site studies are important early in the innovation lifecycle, multisite studies of EHR interventions are critical for generalizability. Because EHR software, configuration, and local context differ considerably across health care organizations, it can be difficult to implement a single, standardized intervention across multiple sites in a study. This article outlines key strengths, weaknesses, challenges, and opportunities for standardization of EHR interventions in multisite studies and describes flexible trial designs suitable for studying complex interventions, including EHR interventions. It also outlines key considerations for reporting on flexible trials of EHR interventions, including sharing details of the process for designing interventions and their content, details of outcomes being studied and approaches for pooling, and the importance of sharing code and configuration whenever possible. © 2020 American College of Physicians.

Methods We invited informatics leaders from a convenience sample of six health care organizations that have recently replaced their long used homegrown systems with commercial EHRs. Participants were asked to complete a written questionnaire with open-ended questions designed to explore if and how their homegrown system(s) is being used and maintained after adoption of a commercial EHR. We used snowball sampling to identify other potential respondents and institutions. Results Participants from all six organizations included in our initial sample completed the questionnaire and provided referrals to four other organizations; from these, two did not respond to our invitations and two had not yet replaced their system and were excluded. Two organizations (Columbia University and University of Alabama at Birmingham) still use their homegrown system for direct patient care and as a downtime system. Four organizations (Intermountain Healthcare, Partners Healthcare, Regenstrief Institute, and Vanderbilt University) kept their systems primarily to access historical data. All organizations reported the need to continue to develop or maintain local applications despite having adopted a commercial EHR. The most common applications developed include display and visualization tools and clinical decision support systems. Conclusion Homegrown EHR systems continue to be used for different purposes according to the experience of six traditional homegrown EHR developers. The annual cost to maintain these systems varies from $21,000 to over 1 million. The collective experience of these organizations indicates that commercial EHRs have not been able to provide all functionality needed for patient care and local applications are often developed for multiple purposes, which presents opportunities for future research and EHR development. © 2020 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.",electronic health records; homegrown systems; meaningful use; medical informatics applications,Electronic Health Records; Meaningful Use; electronic health record; meaningful use criteria,Georg Thieme Verlag,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access

One of the promising standards that aims to address this limitation is Health Level Seven International (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources Clinical Genomics Implementation Guide-Release 1 (FHIR CG IG STU1). This study aims to identify various data content of some genetic lab test reports and map them to FHIR CG IG specification to assess its coverage and to provide some suggestions for standard development and implementation. Materials and Methods: We analyzed sample reports of 4 genetic tests and relevant professional reporting guidelines to identify their key data elements (KDEs) that were then mapped to FHIR CG IG. Results: We identified 36 common KDEs among the analyzed genetic test reports, in addition to other unique KDEs for each genetic test. Relevant suggestions were made to guide the standard implementation and development. Discussion and Conclusion: The FHIR CG IG covers the majority of the identified KDEs. However, we suggested some FHIR extensions that might better represent some KDEs. These extensions may be relevant to FHIR implementations or future FHIR updates. The FHIR CG IG is an excellent step toward the interoperability of genetic lab test reports. However, it is a work-in-progress that needs informative and continuous input from the clinical genetics' community, specifically professional organizations, systems implementers, and genetic knowledgebase providers.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.",Biomedical informatics; FHIR; Genetic results; Genetic test reporting; Interoperability,"Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Electronic Health Records; Genetic Testing; Genomics; Health Level Seven; Humans; article; Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources; genomics; health level 7; human; information science; laboratory test; medical genetics; medical society; practice guideline; clinical decision support system; electronic health record; genetic screening; health level 7",Oxford University Press,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access

Creating “care curves” and comparing individual elements of care over time may highlight modifiable differences in intensive care among centers. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed an observational retrospective study at 5 centers in the United States to describe key elements of postoperative care following the stage 1 palliation. A consecutive sample of 502 infants undergoing stage 1 palliation between January 2009 and December 2018 were included. All electronic health record entries relating to mandatory mechanical ventilator rate, opioid administration, and fluid intake/outputs between postoperative days (POD) 0 to 28 were extracted from each institution’s data warehouse. During the study period, 502 patients underwent stage 1 palliation among the 5 centers. Patients were weaned to a median mandatory mechanical ventilator rate of 10 breaths/minute by POD 4 at Center 5 but not until POD 7 to 8 at Centers 1 and 2. Opioid administration peaked on POD 2 with extreme variance (median 6.9 versus 1.6 mg/kg per day at Center 3 versus Center 2). Daily fluid balance trends were variable: on POD 3 Center 1 had a median fluid balance of −51 mL/kg per day, ranging between −34 to 19 mL/kg per day among remaining centers. Intercenter differences persist after adjusting for patient and surgical characteristics (P<0.001 for each end point). CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to detail and compare individual elements of care over time that represent modifiable differences among centers, which persist even after adjusting for patient factors. Care curves may be used to guide collaborative quality improvement initiatives. © 2021 The Authors.",Congenital heart disease; Intensive care; Postoperative care; Stage 1 palliation,"Critical Care; Humans; Incidence; Intensive Care Units; Palliative Care; Postoperative Care; Postoperative Complications; Quality Improvement; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Surgical Procedures, Operative; Survival Rate; United States; adverse event; clinical trial; comparative study; human; incidence; intensive care; intensive care unit; multicenter study; palliative therapy; postoperative care; postoperative complication; retrospective study; risk factor; surgery; survival rate; total quality management; United States",American Heart Association Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

However, gaps in pediatric-specific functionalities continue to exist in some EHR systems, including population-specific growth curves, immunization clinical decision support, weight-based medication dosing with rounding, calculation of pediatric hypertension percentiles, age-specific developmental assessment, newborn bilirubin nomograms, anticipatory guidance reminders, and other functionalities described elsewhere. Implementing pediatric functionalities into EHRs is critical to the provision of safe pediatric care. As an alternative to direct implementation in EHRs, EHR vendor agnostic Web applications, Web services, and application programming interfaces offer an opportunity to provide pediatric functionalities and eliminate the need for each vendor to develop these functionalities. Successful implementation of Web services and related technologies requires responsible attention from both EHR vendors and developers of Web services, Web applications, and application programming interfaces to the use of data terminology standards, adherence to privacy and security requirements, rigorous testing, change management processes, and robust system support and maintenance. Education of health care providers about opportunities to improve pediatric functionalities in EHRs by using these services can facilitate discussions in EHR user groups in which vendors can be lobbied to implement them. This policy statement emphasizes the need to address pediatric-specific functionalities in EHRs by providing insight and recommendations into the development, maintenance, integration, and support of these novel solutions. © 2021 American Academy of Pediatrics.

Implementing clinical decision support tools to address cardiovascular risk factor awareness in the oncology setting may enhance survivors' attainment or maintenance of cardiovascular health. Objective: We sought to evaluate survivors' awareness of cardiovascular risk factors and examine the usability of a novel electronic health record enabled cardiovascular health tool from the perspective of both breast cancer survivors and oncology providers. Methods: Breast cancer survivors (n=49) recruited from a survivorship clinic interacted with the cardiovascular health tool and completed pre and posttool assessments about cardiovascular health knowledge and perceptions of the tool. Oncologists, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners (n=20) who provide care to survivors also viewed the cardiovascular health tool and completed assessments of perceived usability and acceptability. Results: Enrolled breast cancer survivors (84% White race, 4% Hispanic ethnicity) had been diagnosed 10.8 years ago (SD 6.0) with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage 0, I, or II (45/49, 92%). Prior to viewing the tool, 65% of survivors (32/49) reported not knowing their level for one or more cardiovascular health factors (range 0-4). On average, only 45% (range 0%-86%) of survivors' known cardiovascular health factors were at an ideal level. More than 50% of survivors had ideal smoking status (45/48, 94%) or blood glucose level (29/45, 64%); meanwhile, less than 50% had ideal blood pressure (12/49, 24%), body mass index (12/49, 24%), cholesterol level (17/35, 49%), diet (7/49, 14%), and physical activity (10/49. 20%). More than 90% of survivors thought the tool was easy to understand (46/47, 98%), improved their understanding (43/47, 91%), and was helpful (45/47, 96%); overall, 94% (44/47 survivors) liked the tool. A majority of survivors (44/47, 94%) thought oncologists should discuss cardiovascular health during survivorship care. Most (12/20, 60%) oncology providers (female: 12/20, 60%; physicians: 14/20, 70%) had been practicing for more than 5 years. Most providers agreed the tool provided useful information (18/20, 90%), would help their effectiveness (18/20, 90%), was easy to use (20/20, 100%), and presented information in a useful format (19/20, 95%); and 85% of providers (17/20) reported they would use the tool most or all of the time when providing survivorship care. Conclusions: These usability data demonstrate acceptability of a cardiovascular health clinical decision support tool in oncology practices. Oncology providers and breast cancer survivors would likely value the integration of such apps in survivorship care. By increasing awareness and communication regarding cardiovascular health, electronic health record-enabled tools may improve survivorship care delivery for breast cancer and ultimately patient outcomes. © Kathryn E Weaver, Heidi D Klepin, Brian J Wells, Emily V Dressler, Karen M Winkfield, Zanetta S Lamar, Tiffany P Avery, Nicholas M Pajewski, W Gregory Hundley, Aimee Johnson, Eleanor C Davidson, Marcelo Lopetegui, Randi E Foraker.

One method of adding these capabilities across EHR platforms is to integrate Web services and Web applications that may perform decision support and store data in the cloud when the EHR platform is able to integrate Web services. Specific examples of these services are described, such as immunization clinical decision support services, consumer health resources, and bilirubin nomograms. Health care providers, EHR vendors, and developers share responsibilities in the appropriate development, integration, and use of Web services and Web applications as they relate to best practices in the areas of data security and confidentiality, technical availability, audit trails, terminology and messaging standards, compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, testing, usability, and other considerations. It is desirable for health care providers to have knowledge of Web services and Web applications that can improve pediatric capabilities in their own EHRs because this will naturally inform discussions concerning EHR features and facilitate implementation and subsequent use of these capabilities by clinicians caring for children.

Establishing a CDS system in a health care setting remains a challenge. A few hospitals have used self-developed in-house CDS systems or commercial CDS solutions. Since these in-house CDS systems tend to be tightly coupled with a specific electronic health record system, the functionality and knowledge base are not easily shareable. A shared interoperable CDS system facilitates the sharing of the knowledge base and extension of CDS services. Objective: The study focuses on developing and deploying the national CDS service for the drug-allergy interaction (DAI) check for health care providers in Korea that need to introduce the service but lack the budget and expertise. Methods: To provide the shared interoperable CDS service, we designed and implemented the system based on the CDS Hooks specification and Health Level Seven (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. The study describes the CDS development process. The system development went through requirement analysis, design, implementation, and deployment. In particular, the concept architecture was designed based on the CDS Hooks structure. The MedicationRequest and AllergyIntolerance resources were profiled to exchange data using the FHIR standard. The discovery and DAI check application programming interfaces and rule engine were developed. Results: The CDS service was deployed on G-Cloud, a government cloud service. In March 2021, the CDS service was launched, and 67 health care providers participated in the CDS service. The health care providers participated in the service with 1,008,357 DAI checks for 114,694 patients, of which 33,054 (3.32%) cases resulted in a “warning.” Conclusions: Korea’s Ministry of Health and Welfare has been trying to build an HL7 FHIR-based ecosystem in Korea. As one of these efforts, the CDS service initiative has been conducted. To promote the rapid adoption of the HL7 FHIR standard, it is necessary to accelerate practical service development and to appeal to policy makers regarding the benefits of FHIR standardization. With the development of various case-specific implementation guides using the Korea Core implementation guide, the FHIR standards will be distributed nationwide, and more shared interoperable health care services will be introduced in Korea. ©Sungwon Jung, Sungchul Bae, Donghyeong Seong, Ock Hee Oh, Yoomi Kim, Byoung-Kee Yi.",CDS Hooks; clinical decision support; drug-allergy interaction; Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources; Health Level 7; interoperability,,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

Thirty percent of Americans suffer from chronic noncancer pain at an estimated yearly cost of over $600 billion. Most patients with chronic pain turn to primary care clinicians who must choose from myriad treatment options based on relative risks and benefits, patient history, available resources, symptoms, and goals. Recently, with attention to opioid-related risks, prescribing has declined. However, clinical experts have countered with concerns that some patients for whom opioid-related benefits outweigh risks may be inappropriately discontinued from opioids. Unfortunately, primary care clinicians lack usable tools to help them partner with their patients in choosing pain treatment options that best balance risks and benefits in the context of patient history, resources, symptoms, and goals. Thus, primary care clinicians and patients would benefit from patient-centered clinical decision support (CDS) for this shared decision-making process. Methods: The objective of this 3-year project is to study the adaptation and implementation of an existing interoperable CDS tool for pain treatment shared decision making, with tailored implementation support, in new clinical settings in the OneFlorida Clinical Research Consortium. Our central hypothesis is that tailored implementation support will increase CDS adoption and shared decision making. We further hypothesize that increases in shared decision making will lead to improved patient outcomes, specifically pain and physical function. The CDS implementation will be guided by the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework. The evaluation will be organized by the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. We will adapt and tailor PainManager, an open source interoperable CDS tool, for implementation in primary care clinics affiliated with the OneFlorida Clinical Research Consortium. We will evaluate the effect of tailored implementation support on PainManager’s adoption for pain treatment shared decision making. This evaluation will establish the feasibility and obtain preliminary data in preparation for a multi-site pragmatic trial targeting the effectiveness of PainManager and tailored implementation support on shared decision making and patient-reported pain and physical function. Discussion: This research will generate evidence on strategies for implementing interoperable CDS in new clinical settings across different types of electronic health records (EHRs). The study will also inform tailored implementation strategies to be further tested in a subsequent hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial. Together, these efforts will lead to important new technology and evidence that patients, clinicians, and health systems can use to improve care for millions of Americans who suffer from pain and other chronic conditions.

Social credentials (eg, Google and Facebook) are increasingly used as a federated identity to allow access and reduce the password burden. Single Federated Identity Log-in for Electronic health records (Single-FILE) is a real-world test of the feasibility and acceptability of federated social credentials for patients to access their electronic health records (EHRs) at multiple organizations with a single sign-on (SSO). Objective: This study aims to deploy a federated identity system for health care in a real-world environment so patients can safely use a social identity to access their EHR data at multiple organizations. This will help identify barriers and inform guidance for the deployment of such systems. Methods: Single-FILE allowed patients to pick a social identity (such as Google or Facebook) as a federated identity for multisite EHR patient portal access with an SSO. Binding the identity to the patient’s EHR records was performed by confirming that the patient had a valid portal log-in and sending a one-time passcode to a telephone (SMS text message or voice) number retrieved from the EHR. This reduced the risk of stolen EHR portal credentials. For a real-world test, we recruited 8 patients and (or) their caregivers who had EHR data at 2 independent health care facilities, enrolled them into Single-FILE, and allowed them to use their social identity credentials to access their patient records. We used a short qualitative interview to assess their interest and use of a federated identity for SSO. Single-FILE was implemented as a web-based patient portal, although the concept can be readily implemented on a variety of mobile platforms. Results: We interviewed the patients and their caregivers to assess their comfort levels with using a social identity for access. Patients noted that they appreciated only having to remember 1 log-in as part of Single-FILE and being able to sign up through Facebook. Conclusions: Our results indicate that from a technical perspective, a social identity can be used as a federated identity that is bound to a patient’s EHR data. The one-time passcode sent to the patient’s EHR phone number provided assurance that the binding is valid. The patients indicated that they were comfortable with using their social credentials instead of having to remember the log-in credentials for their EHR portal. Our experience will help inform the implementation of federated identity systems in health care in the United States. © 2022. JMIR Publications Inc..

The Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) guiding principles have been conceptualized to enable data interoperability. Many studies provide implementation guidelines, assessment metrics, and software to achieve FAIR-compliant data, especially for health data sets. Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is a health data content modeling and exchange standard. Objective: Our goal was to devise a new methodology to extract, transform, and load existing health data sets into HL7 FHIR repositories in line with FAIR principles, develop a Data Curation Tool to implement the methodology, and evaluate it on health data sets from 2 different but complementary institutions. We aimed to increase the level of compliance with FAIR principles of existing health data sets through standardization and facilitate health data sharing by eliminating the associated technical barriers. Methods: Our approach automatically processes the capabilities of a given FHIR end point and directs the user while configuring mappings according to the rules enforced by FHIR profile definitions. Code system mappings can be configured for terminology translations through automatic use of FHIR resources. The validity of the created FHIR resources can be automatically checked, and the software does not allow invalid resources to be persisted. At each stage of our data transformation methodology, we used particular FHIR-based techniques so that the resulting data set could be evaluated as FAIR. We performed a data-centric evaluation of our methodology on health data sets from 2 different institutions. Results: Through an intuitive graphical user interface, users are prompted to configure the mappings into FHIR resource types with respect to the restrictions of selected profiles. Once the mappings are developed, our approach can syntactically and semantically transform existing health data sets into HL7 FHIR without loss of data utility according to our privacy-concerned criteria. In addition to the mapped resource types, behind the scenes, we create additional FHIR resources to satisfy several FAIR criteria. According to the data maturity indicators and evaluation methods of the FAIR Data Maturity Model, we achieved the maximum level (level 5) for being Findable, Accessible, and Interoperable and level 3 for being Reusable. Conclusions: We developed and extensively evaluated our data transformation approach to unlock the value of existing health data residing in disparate data silos to make them available for sharing according to the FAIR principles. We showed that our method can successfully transform existing health data sets into HL7 FHIR without loss of data utility, and the result is FAIR in terms of the FAIR Data Maturity Model. We support institutional migration to HL7 FHIR, which not only leads to FAIR data sharing but also eases the integration with different research networks. © A Anil Sinaci, Mert Gencturk, Huseyin Alper Teoman, Gokce Banu Laleci Erturkmen, Celia Alvarez-Romero, Alicia Martinez-Garcia, Beatriz Poblador-Plou, Jonás Carmona-Pírez, Matthias Löbe, Carlos Luis Parra-Calderon.",Accessible; FAIR principles; Findable; health data sharing; health data transformation; Health Level 7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources; HL7 FHIR; Interoperable; Reusable principles; secondary use,Electronic Health Records; Health Level Seven; Humans; Information Dissemination; Software; Software Design; hemoglobin; Article; controlled study; data privacy; evaluation study; FAIR principles; Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources; female; global health; health data; hospital readmission; human; male; medical terminology; prescription; software design; standardization; electronic health record; health level 7; information dissemination; software; software design,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

The resulting repository of multi-dimensional data can be used for precision medicine analysis of physiological readouts, acute medical conditions, and adverse events that can occur during surgery. Materials and methods A structured pipeline was developed atop our existing anesthesia data warehouse using open-source tools. The pipeline is automated using scheduled tasks. The pipeline runs weekly, and finds and identifies all new and existing anesthetic records for BioMe participants. Results The pipeline went live in June 2015 with 49.2% (n = 15,673) of BioMe participants linked to 40,947 anesthetics. The pipeline runs weekly in minimal time. After eighteen months, an additional 3671 participants were enrolled in BioMe and the number of matched anesthetic records grew 21% to 49,545. Overall percentage of BioMe patients with anesthetics remained similar at 51.1% (n = 18,128). Seven patients opted out during this time. The median number of anesthetics per participant was 2 (range 1–144). Collectively, there were over 35 million physiologic data points and 480,000 medication administrations linked to genomic data. To date, two projects are using the pipeline at MSHS. Conclusion Automated integration of biobank and anesthetic data sources is feasible and practical. This integration enables large-scale genomic analyses that might inform variable physiological response to anesthetic and surgical stress, and examine genetic factors underlying adverse outcomes during and after surgery. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",,"Anesthesia, General; Data Collection; Databases, Factual; Delivery of Health Care; Electronic Health Records; Genome; Genomics; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Surgical Procedures, Operative; Anesthesiology; Anesthetics; Automation; Data warehouses; Genes; Physiological models; Physiology; Pipelines; Surgery; Transplantation (surgical); anesthetic agent; Anesthetic records; Design and implements; Integrating the healthcare enterprise; Medical conditions; Multidimensional data; Open source tools; Physiological data; Physiological response; acute disease; anesthesia induction; Article; biobank; conceptual framework; data base; electronic medical record; genomics; human; integrated Genomics Anesthesia System; integrated health care system; perioperative period; personalized medicine; postoperative complication; surgical stress; electronic health record; factual database; general anesthesia; genome; genomics; health care delivery; information processing; information retrieval; surgery; trends; Data integration",Academic Press Inc.,,,,Article,Final,

The storage of online data, massive means of analysis such as facial recognitions algorithms poses a serious issue when it comes to the protection of personal data. We will assess a platform's benefits in connection with the computerized medical record, which will allow keeping the photos filed and centralized in a smart and secure manner. Method: We interviewed 300 plastic surgeons about the role of smartphone in their clinical practice. Concomitantly, we developed an innovative platform called Surgeon©, a secure way to index, file and send photographs with a smartphone on our hospital's server. Each photographic sequence was qualified using a specific form. We then collected prospectively, between May 1st 2017 and March 30th 2018, the number of patients photographed, the number of sequences and photographs taken and the average number of sequences per patient. Results: Out of 86 French plastic surgeons surveyed, 81% say that they could not go on with their daily practice today without their smartphone. Photographs taken were stored in their smartphones (50%) or synced with virtual storage (25.6%). A majority (80.2%) would use a dedicated secured smartphone application. Our application allowed us to photograph 979 patients, or 2345 sequences and 8112 photographs, with an average of 2.28 sequences per patient.

Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) collect data directly from patients for use in clinical practice by helping decision making and tailoring treatments according to the patients’ needs. The authors present a novel database to overcome data collection related barriers, calculating automatically the questionnaire results, displayed in graphics on the patients’ dashboard in real time, and focused on the active follow of the patients. Objective: To present electronic health record database for monitoring clinical or surgical interventions and assess the usability. Methodology: Process modeling and specification of system requirements were performed using the Iconix methodology along with the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) to validate the usability and usefulness of the proposed system. The system and the questionnaires were performed in three languages: Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, and English. Results: The database enables researchers to use the questionnaires defining the time of data collection according to the needs of each clinical study. The system facilitates the patient answers without any personal interference from smartphones, tablets or computers. The questionnaire scores were calculated automatically in real time and displayed in graphics on the patients’ dashboard. The evaluation of the usability and usefulness of the developed database used 8 people divided into two equal groups (4 physicians and 4 medical students).

However, the role of normoxia for critically ill trauma patients remains uncertain. The objective of this study is to describe the study protocol and statistical analysis plan for the Strategy to Avoid Excessive Oxygen for Critically Ill Trauma Patients (SAVE-O2) clinical trial. Methods: Design, setting, and participants: Protocol for a multicenter cluster randomized, stepped wedge implementation trial evaluating the effectiveness of a multimodal intervention to target normoxia in critically ill trauma patients at eight level 1 trauma centers in the USA. Each hospital will contribute pre-implementation (control) and post-implementation (intervention) data. All sites will begin in the control phase with usual care. When sites reach their randomly assigned time to transition, there will be a one-month training period, which does not contribute to data collection. Following the 1-month training period, the site will remain in the intervention phase for the duration of the trial. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome will be supplemental oxygen-free days, defined as the number of days alive and not on supplemental oxygen. Secondary outcomes include in-hospital mortality to day 90, hospital-free days to day 90, ventilator-free days (VFD) to day 28, time to room air, Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS), and duration of time receiving supplemental oxygen. Discussion: SAVE-O2 will determine if a multimodal intervention to improve compliance with targeted normoxia will safely reduce the need for concentrated oxygen for critically injured trauma patients. These data will inform military stakeholders regarding oxygen requirements for critically injured warfighters, while reducing logistical burden in prolonged combat casualty care.

We describe the iterative human-centered design and pilot process for multiple sclerosis (MS) NeuroShare, a digital health solution that brings practical information to the point of care so that clinicians and patients with MS can view, discuss, and make informed decisions together.MethodsWe initiated a comprehensive human-centered process to iteratively design, develop, and implement a digital health solution for managing MS in the routine outpatient setting of the nonprofit Sutter Health system in Northern California. The human-centered codesign process included 3 phases: discovery and design, development, and implementation and pilot. Stakeholders included Sutter Health's Research Development and Dissemination team, academic domain experts, neurologists, patients with MS, and an advisory group.ResultsMS NeuroShare went live in November 2018. It included a patient- and clinician-facing web application that launches from the electronic health record, visually displays a patient's data relevant to MS, and prompts the clinician to comprehensively evaluate and treat the patient. Both patients and clinicians valued the ability to jointly view patient-generated and other data. Preliminary results suggest that MS NeuroShare promotes patient-clinician communication and more active patient participation in decision-making.ConclusionsLessons learned in the design and implementation of MS NeuroShare are broadly applicable to the design and implementation of digital tools aiming to improve the experience of delivering and receiving high-quality care for complex, neurologic conditions across large health systems. © American Academy of Neurology.",,,Lippincott Williams and Wilkins,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access

As EHRs developed, design principles focused on transferring existing paper-based documentation to comparable electronic forms. In addition, a strong industry focus on adult healthcare settings and quality measures has limited attention and resources for high priority EHR functionality needed for the unique health care of children. The objective of this paper is to provide a review of innovation in the EHR, that includes a variety of established and emerging technologies that may help realize a more effective EHR in child health settings. A more effective EHR would serve as an electronic hub. Existing EHR infrastructure could provide the foundation upon which new technologies and approaches branch and extend, enabling more rapid and customizable innovation to better meet shifting stakeholder and end-user needs. Among many areas for improvement, key goals of innovation could include technology that relieves ambulatory primary care clinician documentation burden, identifies needs, and supports improved care coordination and outcomes, focused on the following key areas: identification of child and family care needs, decision support, documentation, care coordination, and family communication. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",,Adult; Child; Documentation; Electronic Health Records; Humans; article; child; child health; decision support system; electronic health record; family counseling; human; outcome assessment; primary medical care; adult; documentation,Elsevier Inc.,,,,Article,Final,

This is due in part to limited coordination among CDS components. To improve coordination of CDS components, Health Level 7 (HL7) has developed a suite of interoperability standards with Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR) specification as a common information model. Evidence is needed to determine the feasibility of implementing these CDS components; therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the coordination of emerging HL7 standards with modular CDS architecture components. Methods: We used a modular, standards-based architecture consisting of four components: data, logic, services, and applications. The implementation use-case was an application to support shared decision making in the context of drug-drug interactions (DDInteract). Results: DDInteract uses FHIR as the data representation model, Clinical Quality Language for logic representation, CDS Hooks for the services layer, and Substitutable Medical Apps Reusable Technologies for application integration. DDInteract was first implemented in a sandbox environment and then in an electronic health record (Epic®) test environment. DDInteract can be integrated in clinical workflows through on-demand access from a menu or through CDS Hooks upon opening a patient's record or placing a medication order. Conclusion: In the context of drug interactions, DDInteract is the first application to leverage a full stack of emerging interoperability standards for each component of modular CDS architecture. The demonstrated feasibility of interoperable components can be generalized to other modular CDS applications. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Clinical decision support; Drug-drug interactions; Electronic health record; HL7 FHIR; Interoperability,Architecture; Computer circuits; Computer software reusability; Decision making; Decision support systems; Drug interactions; eHealth; Records management; Case-studies; Clinical decision support; Drug-drug interactions; Health level 7 fast health interoperability resource; Healthcare organizations; Information Modeling; Modulars; Resource specification; Services and applications; Shared decision makings; Article; clinical decision support system; data integration; decision tree; drug interaction; electronic health record; health care organization; health level 7; human; ICD-10; information model; medical informatics; patient coding; regression model; shared decision making; standard; Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine; Interoperability,Elsevier Ireland Ltd,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access

Few studies have evaluated socioeconomic barriers to PROM completion, and none have done so in a spine patient population. PURPOSE: To identify patient barriers to PROM completion one year following lumbar spine fusion. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Retrospective single-institution cohort study. PATIENT SAMPLE: A total of 2,984 patients undergoing lumbar fusion between 2014 and 2020 OUTCOME MEASURES: Completion of Mental Component Score (MCS-12) and Physical Component Score (PCS-12) of Short Form-12 questionnaire 1 year postoperatively. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of all patients undergoing 1-3-level lumbar fusion at a single urban tertiary center. PROMs were queried from our prospectively managed electronic outcomes database. Patients were considered to have complete PROMs if 1-year outcomes were available. Community-level characteristics were collected from patients’ zip codes using the Economic Innovation Group Distressed Communities Index. Bivariate analyses were performed to assess factors associated with PROM incompletion along with multivariate logistic regression to control for confounders. RESULTS: A total of 1,968 (66.0%) had incomplete 1-year PROMs. Patients with incomplete PROMs were more likely to be Black (14.5% vs 9.3%, p<.001), Hispanic (2.9% vs 1.6%, p=.027), reside in a distressed community (14.7% vs 8.5%, p<.001), and be active smokers (22.4% vs 15.5%, p<.001). On multivariate regression, Black race (OR: 1.46, p=.014, Hispanic ethnicity (OR: 2.19, p=.027), distressed community status (OR: 1.47, p=.024), workers’ compensation status (OR: 2.82, p=.001), and active smoking (OR:1.31, p=.034) all were independently associated with PROM incompletion. Surgical characteristics, including primary surgeon, revision status, approach, and levels fused were not associated with PROM incompletion. CONCLUSIONS: Social determinants of health impact completion of PROMs. Patients completing PROMs are overwhelmingly White, non-Hispanic, and reside in wealthier communities. Efforts should be taken to provide better education regarding PROMs and ensure closer follow-up of certain subgroups of patients to avoid furthering disparities in PROM research. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Disparities; Lumbar spine; Patient reported outcomes; Social determinants; Socioeconomic status; Spine fusion,Cohort Studies; Humans; Lumbar Vertebrae; Lumbosacral Region; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Retrospective Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; Spinal Fusion; Treatment Outcome; adult; article; bivariate analysis; Black person; Caucasian; cohort analysis; confounding variable; current smoker; education; ethnicity; female; follow up; Hispanic; human; lumbar spine; major clinical study; male; mental health; outcome assessment; patient-reported outcome; prospective study; questionnaire; retrospective study; Short Form 12; smoking; social determinants of health; social status; socioeconomics; spine fusion; surgeon; workman compensation; lumbar vertebra; lumbosacral region; patient-reported outcome; socioeconomics; surgery; treatment outcome,Elsevier Inc.,,,,Article,Final,

Introduction: Patient portals provide patients with access to their health information directly from EHRs within hospitals, primary care centres and general practices (GPs). Patient portals offer many benefits to patients including improved communication with healthcare providers and care coordination. However, many challenges exist with the integration and automatic and secure sharing of information between EHRs and patient portals. It is critical that countries learn from international experiences to successfully develop interoperable national patient portals. Methods: A scoping review methodology was undertaken. A search strategy using index terms and keywords was applied across four key databases, an additional grey literature search was also run. The identified studies were screened by two reviewers to determine eligibility against defined inclusion criteria. Data were abstracted from the eligible studies and reviewed to identify the key requirements and challenges to interoperability of patient portals with EHRs. Results: After screening 3,462 studies, 34 were included across 11 countries. Of the 29 unique patient portals studied, few offered patients access to their entire healthcare record across multiple sites and a number of different functionalities were available. Key interoperability requirements and challenges identified were: Data Sharing Incentives & Supports; Heterogenous Organisations & Information Systems; Data Storage & Management; Available Information & Functionalities; Data Formats & Standards; Identification of Individuals; User Access, Control & Consent; and Security & Privacy. Conclusion: Seamless exchange of health information across patient portals and EHRs required organisational and individual factors, as well as technical considerations. Interorganisational collaboration and engagement of key stakeholders to determine standards and guidelines for consent and sharing of information, as well as technical standards and security measures were recommended. © 2023",Electronic Health Record; Interoperability; Patient Portal; Scoping Review,Communication; Data Management; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Patient Portals; Access control; Diagnosis; Digital storage; eHealth; Electronic document exchange; Information dissemination; Information management; Records management; Electronic health; Electronic health record; Health care providers; Health informations; Health records; International experiences; Learn+; Patient portal; Primary care; Scoping review; aged; article; drug therapy; electronic health record; general practice; general practitioner; grey literature; health care personnel; human; information storage; medical information; medical record; practice guideline; primary medical care; privacy; scoping review; systematic review; information processing; information retrieval; interpersonal communication; Interoperability,Elsevier Ireland Ltd,,,,Article,Final,

The Morehouse Choice Accountable Care Organization and Education System (MCACO-ES), or (M-ACO) is a physician led integrated delivery model participating in the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) offered through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Innovation Center. The MSSP establishes incentivized, performance-based payment models for qualifying health care organizations serving traditional Medicare beneficiaries that promote collaborative efficiency models designed to mitigate fragmented and insufficient access to health care, reduce unnecessary cost, and improve clinical outcomes. The M-ACO integration model is administered through participant organizations that include a multi-site community based academic practice, independent physician practices, and federally qualified health center systems (FQHCs). This manuscript aims to present a descriptive and exploratory assessment of health care programs and related innovation methods that validate M-ACO as a reliable simulator to implement, evaluate, and refine M-ACO’s integration model to render value-based performance outcomes over time. A part of the research approach also includes early outcomes and lessons learned advancing the framework for ongoing testing of M-ACO’s integration model across independently owned, rural, and urban health care locations that predominantly serve low-income, traditional Medicare beneficiaries, (including those who also qualify for Medicaid benefits (also referred to as “dual eligibles”). M-ACO seeks to determine how integration potentially impacts targeted performance results. As a simulator to test value-based innovation and related clinical and business practices, M-ACO uses enterprise-level data and advanced analytics to measure certain areas, including: 1) health program insight and effectiveness; 2) optimal implementation process and workflows that align primary care with specialists to expand access to care; 3) chronic care management/coordination deployment as an effective extender service to physicians and patients risk stratified based on defined clinical and social determinant criteria; 4) adoption of technology tools for patient outreach and engagement, including a mobile application for remote biometric monitoring and telemedicine; and 5) use of structured communication platforms that enable practitioner engagement and ongoing training regarding the shift from volume to value-based care delivery. © 2019 by the authors.

Such underrepresentation results in a gap in the evidence base, and health disparities. The ABC Cardiovascular Implementation Study (CVIS) is a comprehensive prospective cohort registry that integrates social determinants of health. ABC CVIS uses real world clinical practice data to address critical gaps in care by facilitating robust participation of African Americans and other minorities in clinical trials. ABC CVIS will include diverse patients from collaborating ABC member private practices, as well as patients from academic health centers and Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). This paper describes the rationale and design of the ABC CVIS Registry. The registry will: (1) prospectively collect socio-demographic, clinical and biospecimen data from enrolled adults, adolescents and children with prioritized cardiovascular diseases; (2) Evaluate the safety and clinical outcomes of new therapeutic agents, including post marketing surveillance and pharmacovigilance; (3) Support National Institutes of Health (NIH) and industry sponsored research; (4) Support Quality Measures standards from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and Commercial Health Plans. The registry will utilize novel data and technology tools to facilitate mobile health technology application programming interface (API) to health system or practice electronic health records (EHR).

Although there are requirements for continuing medical education, resources for learning new clinical guidelines, and developing fields aimed at facilitating peer-to-peer feedback, there is a gap in the availability of tools that enable clinicians to learn based on their own patients and clinical decisions. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the technologies or modifications to existing systems that could be used to benefit hospitalist physicians in pursuing self-assessment and improvement by understanding physicians’ current practices and their reactions to proposed possibilities. Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted in two separate stages with analysis performed after each stage. In the first stage, interviews (N=12) were conducted to understand the ways in which hospitalist physicians are currently gathering feedback and assessing their practice. A thematic analysis of these interviews informed the prototype used to elicit responses in the second stage. Results: Clinicians actively look for feedback that they can apply to their practice, with the majority of the feedback obtained through self-assessment. The following three themes surrounding this aspect were identified in the first round of semistructured interviews: collaboration, self-reliance, and uncertainty, each with three related subthemes. Using a wireframe, the second round of interviews led to identifying the features that are currently challenging to use or could be made available with technology. Conclusions: Based on each theme and subtheme, we provide targeted recommendations for use by relevant stakeholders such as institutions, clinicians, and technologists. Most hospitalist self-assessments occur on a rolling basis, specifically using data in electronic medical records as their primary source. Specific objective data points or subjective patient relationships lead clinicians to review their patient cases and to assess their own performance. However, current systems are not built for these analyses or for clinicians to perform self-assessment, making this a burdensome and incomplete process. Building a platform that focuses on providing and curating the information used for self-assessment could help physicians make more accurately informed changes to their own clinical practice and decision-making. ©Andrew Lukas Yin, Pargol Gheissari, Inna Wanyin Lin, Michael Sobolev, John P Pollak, Curtis Cole, Deborah Estrin.",Assessment; Digital health; Electronic medical record; Feedback; Hospitalist; Learning; Self-assessment; Self-learning,"Digital Technology; Electronic Health Records; Female; Hospitalists; Humans; Interview, Psychological; Male; Self-Assessment; adult; article; clinical article; clinical practice; decision making; electronic medical record; female; human; learning; male; medical education; self evaluation; semi structured interview; thematic analysis; uncertainty; electronic health record; medical staff; procedures; psychological interview; self evaluation",JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

Efforts such as The Cancer Genome Atlas have characterized the cancer genome and suggested a wealth of targets for implementing precision medicine strategies for patients with cancer. The data produced from research studies and clinical care have many potential secondary uses beyond their originally intended purpose. Effective storage, query, retrieval, and visualization of these data are essential to create an infrastructure to enable new discoveries in cancer research. METHODS Moffitt Cancer Center implemented a molecular data warehouse to complement the extensive enterprise clinical data warehouse (Health and Research Informatics). Seven different sequencing experiment types were included in the warehouse, with data from institutional research studies and clinical sequencing. RESULTS The implementation of the molecular warehouse involved the close collaboration of many teams with different expertise and a use case-focused approach. Cornerstones of project success included project planning, open communication, institutional buy-in, piloting the implementation, implementing custom solutions to address specific problems, data quality improvement, and data governance, unique aspects of which are featured here. We describe our experience in selecting, configuring, and loading molecular data into the molecular data warehouse. Specifically, we developed solutions for heterogeneous genomic sequencing cohorts (many different platforms) and integration with our existing clinical data warehouse.

Clinical decision support (CDS) has the potential to aid clinicians in identifying patients who could benefit from medication changes. This study designed an alert to control hypertension in CKD patients using an iterative human-centered design process. Methods: In this study, we present a human-centered design process employing multiple methods for gathering user requirements and feedback on design and usability. Initially, we conducted contextual inquiry sessions to gather user requirements for the CDS. This was followed by group design sessions and one-on-one formative think-aloud sessions to validate requirements, obtain feedback on the design and layout, uncover usability issues, and validate changes. Results: This study included 20 participants. The contextual inquiry produced 10 user requirements which influenced the initial alert design. The group design sessions revealed issues related to several themes, including recommendations and clinical content that did not match providers' expectations and extraneous information on the alerts that did not provide value. Findings from the individual think-aloud sessions revealed that participants disagreed with some recommended clinical actions, requested additional information, and had concerns about the placement in their workflow. Following each step, iterative changes were made to the alert content and design. Discussion: This study showed that participation from users throughout the design process can lead to a better understanding of user requirements and optimal design, even within the constraints of an EHR alerting system. While raising awareness of design needs, it also revealed concerns related to workflow, understandability, and relevance. Conclusion: The human-centered design framework using multiple methods for CDS development informed the creation of an alert to assist in the treatment and recognition of hypertension in patients with CKD. © 2022, The Author(s).",Clinical decision support systems; Health information technology; Human-centered design,"Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Feedback; Humans; Hypertension; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Workflow; chronic kidney failure; clinical decision support system; complication; feedback system; human; hypertension; workflow",BioMed Central Ltd,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

However, parents are rarely, if ever, offered tobacco use treatment through pediatric settings. Clinical decision support (CDS) systems developed for the workflows of pediatric primary care may support consistent screening, treatment, and referral. Objectives This study aimed to develop a CDS system by using human-centered design (HCD) that identifies parents who smoke, provides motivational messages to quit smoking (informed by behavioral science), and supports delivery of evidence-based tobacco treatment. Methods Our multidisciplinary team applied a rigorous HCD process involving analysis of the work environment, user involvement in formative design, iterative improvements, and evaluation of the system's use in context with the following three cohorts: (1) parents who smoke, (2) pediatric clinicians, and (3) clinic staff. Participants from each cohort were presented with scenario-based, high-fidelity mockups of system components and then provided input related to their role in using the CDS system. Results We engaged 70 representative participants including 30 parents, 30 clinicians, and 10 clinic staff. A key theme of the design review sessions across all cohorts was the need to automate functions of the system. Parents emphasized a system that presented information in a simple way, highlighted benefits of quitting smoking, and allowed direct connection to treatment. Pediatric clinicians emphasized automating tobacco treatment. Clinical staff emphasized screening for parent smoking via several modalities prior to the patient's visit. Once the system was developed, most parents (80%) reported that it was easy to use, and the majority of pediatricians reported that they would use the system (97%) and were satisfied with it (97%). Conclusion A CDS system to support parental tobacco cessation in pediatric primary care, developed through an HCD process, proved easy to use and acceptable to parents, clinicians, and office staff. This preliminary work justifies evaluating the impact of the system on helping parents quit smoking. © 2022 EDP Sciences.

A critical component for any PHM program is a data analytics platform that can target those eligible individuals. Objective: The aim of this study was to design and implement a scalable standards-based clinical decision support (CDS) approach to identify patient cohorts for PHM and maximize opportunities for multi-site dissemination. Materials and Methods: An architecture was established to support bidirectional data exchanges between heterogeneous electronic health record (EHR) data sources, PHM systems, and CDS components. HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources and CDS Hooks were used to facilitate interoperability and dissemination. The approach was validated by deploying the platform at multiple sites to identify patients who meet the criteria for genetic evaluation of familial cancer. Results: The Genetic Cancer Risk Detector (GARDE) platform was created and is comprised of four components: (1) an open-source CDS Hooks server for computing patient eligibility for PHM cohorts, (2) an open-source Population Coordinator that processes GARDE requests and communicates results to a PHM system, (3) an EHR Patient Data Repository, and (4) EHR PHM Tools to manage patients and perform outreach functions. Site-specific deployments were performed on onsite virtual machines and cloud-based Amazon Web Services. Discussion: GARDE's component architecture establishes generalizable standards-based methods for computing PHM cohorts. Replicating deployments using one of the established deployment methods requires minimal local customization. Most of the deployment effort was related to obtaining site-specific information technology governance approvals. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

However, patients' data tracking does not automatically lead to data sharing and discussion with clinicians, which can make it difficult to utilize and derive optimal benefit from PGD. In this paper, we investigate whether and how patients share their PGD with clinicians and the types of challenges that arise within this context. We describe patients' immediate experiences of PGD sharing with clinicians, based on our short onsite interviews with 57 patients who had just met with a clinician at a university health center. Our analyses identified overarching patterns in patients' PGD sharing practices and the associated challenges that arise from the information asymmetry between patients and clinicians and from patients' reliance on their memory to share their PGD. We discuss the implications of our findings for designing PGD-integrated health IT systems in ways to support patients' tracking of relevant PGD, clinicians' effective engagement with patients around PGD, and the efficient sharing and review of PGD within clinical settings.  © 2022 ACM.",data tracking and sharing; doctor-patient communication; patient empowerment; patient-generated data; qualitative study,Data Sharing; Data-tracking; Doctor-patient communication; Health centers; Information asymmetry; Patient data; Patient empowerments; Patient-centered care; Patient-generated data; Qualitative study,Association for Computing Machinery,,,,Article,Final,

We derived RACE (Review, Assess, Classify, and Evaluate) framework through the integration of existing methodologies for the purpose of analyzing m-health apps, and applied it to study opioid apps. Materials and Methods: The 3-step RACE framework integrates established methods and evidence-based criteria used in a successive manner to identify and analyze m-health apps: the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, inter-rater reliability analysis, and Nickerson-Varshney-Muntermann taxonomy. Results: Using RACE, 153 opioid apps were identified, assessed, and classified leading to dimensions of Target Audience, Key Function, Operation, Security & Privacy, and Impact, with Cohen's kappa < 1.0 suggesting subjectivity in app narrative assessments. The most common functions were education (24%), prescription (16%), reminder-monitoring-support (13%), and treatment & recovery (37%). A majority are passive apps (56%). The target audience are patients (49%), healthcare professionals (39%), and others (12%). Security & Privacy is evident in 84% apps. Discussion: Applying the 3-step RACE framework revealed patterns and gaps in opioid apps leading to systematization of knowledge. Lessons learned can be applied to the study of m-health apps for other health conditions. Conclusion: With over 350 000 existing and emerging m-health apps, RACE shows promise as a robust and replicable framework for analyzing m-health apps for specific health conditions.

Recognition of incidental findings frequently relies on manual review of textual radiology reports and can be overlooked in a busy clinical environment. Our study aimed to develop and validate a supervised machine learning model using natural language processing to automate the recognition of incidental findings in radiology reports of patients discharged from the ED. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of computed tomography (CT) reports from trauma patients discharged home across an integrated health system in 2019. Two independent annotators manually labeled CT reports for the presence of an incidental finding as a reference standard. We used regular expressions to derive and validate a random forest model using open-source and machine learning software. Final model performance was assessed across different ED types. Results: The study CT reports were divided into derivation (690 reports) and validation (282 reports) sets, with a prevalence of incidental findings of 22.3%, and 22.7%, respectively. The random forest model had an area under the curve of 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84 to 0.92) on the derivation set and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.88 to 0.96) on the validation set. The final model was found to have a sensitivity of 92.2%, a specificity of 79.4%, and a negative predictive value of 97.2%. Similarly, strong model performance was found when stratified to a dedicated trauma center, high-volume, and low-volume community EDs. Conclusion: Machine learning and natural language processing can classify incidental findings in CT reports of ED patients with high sensitivity and high negative predictive value across a broad range of ED settings. These findings suggest the utility of natural language processing in automating the review of free-text reports to identify incidental findings and may facilitate interventions to improve timely follow-up. © 2022 American College of Emergency Physicians",,"Emergency Service, Hospital; Humans; Incidental Findings; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Patient Discharge; Radiology; Retrospective Studies; adult; area under the curve; Article; Caucasian; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; diagnostic imaging; diagnostic test accuracy study; emergency health service; emergency physician; emergency ward; female; follow up; health care; high volume hospital; hospital discharge; human; incidental finding; injury; interrater reliability; kidney; liver; low volume hospital; lung; machine learning; male; mediastinum; medical informatics; natural language processing; predictive value; prevalence; random forest; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; standard; supervised machine learning; support vector machine; uterus; hospital discharge; hospital emergency service; incidental finding; machine learning; radiology",Elsevier Inc.,,,,Article,Final,

The goal is to better control the onset of possible side effects between the scheduled visits at the clinic. Methods: We analyze the architectural components required to ensure a high level of abstraction from data. Clinical practice guidelines were formalized with Alium, an authoring tool based on the PROforma language, using SNOMED-CT as a terminology standard. The Alium engine is accessible through a set of APIs that may be leveraged for implementing an application based on standard web technologies to be used by doctors at the clinic. Data sent by patients using mobile devices need to be complemented with those already available in the Electronic Health Record to generate personalized recommendations. Thus a middleware pursuing data abstraction is required. To comply with current standards, we adopted the HL7 Virtual Medical Record for Clinical Decision Support Logical Model, Release 2. Results: The developed architecture for monitoring outpatients includes: (1) a guideline-based Decision Support System accessible through a web application that helps the doctors with prevention, diagnosis and treatment of therapy side effects; (2) an application for mobile devices, which allows patients to regularly send data to the clinic. In order to tailor the monitoring procedures to the specific patient, the Decision Support System also helps physicians with the configuration of the mobile application, suggesting the data to be collected and the associated collection frequency that may change over time, according to the individual patient’s conditions. A proof of concept has been developed with a system for monitoring the side effects of chemo-radiotherapy in head and neck cancer patients. Conclusions: Our environment introduces two main innovation elements with respect to similar works available in the literature. First, in order to meet the specific patients’ needs, in our work the Decision Support System also helps the physicians in properly configuring the mobile application. Then the Decision Support System is also continuously fed by patient-reported outcomes. © Schattauer 2017.",Clinical; Decision support systems; Head and neck neoplasms; Mobile health; Patient monitoring; Patient reported outcome measures,"Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Female; Humans; Male; Monitoring, Physiologic; Outpatients; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Smoking; User-Computer Interface; clinical decision support system; computer interface; female; human; male; outpatient; physiologic monitoring; practice guideline; smoking",Schattauer GmbH,,,,Article,Final,

The i2b2 platform has several components with numerous dependencies and configuration parameters, which renders the task of installing or upgrading i2b2 a challenging one. Even with the availability of extensive documentation and tutorials, new users often require several weeks to correctly install a functional i2b2 platform. The goal of this work is to simplify the installation and upgrade process for i2b2. Specifically, we have containerized the core components of the platform, and evaluated the containers for ease of installation. Results: We developed three Docker container images: WildFly, database, and web, to encapsulate the three major deployment components of i2b2. These containers isolate the core functionalities of the i2b2 platform, and work in unison to provide its functionalities. Our evaluations indicate that i2b2 containers function successfully on the Linux platform. Our results demonstrate that the containerized components work out-of-the-box, with minimal configuration. Conclusions: Containerization offers the potential to package the i2b2 platform components into standalone executable packages that are agnostic to the underlying host operating system. By releasing i2b2 as a Docker container, we anticipate that users will be able to create a working i2b2 hive installation without the need to download, compile, and configure individual components that constitute the i2b2 cells, thus making this platform accessible to a greater number of institutions. © 2018 The Author(s).",Biomedical research; Computerized; Containerization; Docker; Docker; High performance computing; I2B2; Information storage and retrieval; Medical records systems; Software; Systems integration; User-computer Interface,Biomedical Research; Humans; Medical Informatics Applications; Medical Informatics Computing; Point-of-Care Systems; human; medical informatics; medical research; point of care system,BioMed Central Ltd,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

Methods In this large multisite trial with a diverse patient population, we evaluated the relationship between sociodemographic factors and FHH health risk assessment uptake using an information technology (IT) platform. The entire study was administered online, including consent, baseline survey, and risk assessment completion. We used multivariate logistic regression to model effect of sociodemographic factors on study progression. Quality of FHH data entered as defined as relatives: (1) with age of onset reported on relevant conditions; (2) if deceased, with cause of death and (3) age of death reported; and (4) percentage of relatives with medical history marked as unknown was analyzed using grouped logistic fixed effect regression. Results A total of 2,514 participants consented with a mean age of 57 and 10.4% minority. Multivariate modeling showed that progression through study stages was more likely for younger (p -value = 0.005), more educated (p -value = 0.004), non-Asian (p -value = 0.009), and female (p -value = 0.005) participants. Those with lower health literacy or information-seeking confidence were also less likely to complete the study. Most significant drop-out occurred during the risk assessment completion phase. Overall, quality of FHH data entered was high with condition's age of onset reported 87.85%, relative's cause of death 85.55% and age of death 93.76%, and relative's medical history marked as unknown 19.75% of the time. Conclusion A demographically diverse population was able to complete an IT-based risk assessment but there were differences in attrition by sociodemographic factors. More attention should be given to ensure end-user functionality of health IT and leverage electronic medical records to lessen patient burden. © 2019 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.

Although several studies on mEHR systems were conducted, including those analyzing their effects and HCPs’ usage frequency, only a few considered the specific workflows of doctors based on their specialties in which the work process differs greatly. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the differences in mEHR usage paths across clinical specialties. Methods: We collected the log data of 974 doctors who worked from August 2016 to August 2017 and used the mEHR system at the Samsung Medical Center, one of the biggest hospitals in South Korea. The doctors were classified into 3 groups based on their specialty: the physician, the surgeon, and other hospital-based physician (OHBP) groups. We used various descriptive and visualization methods to understand and compare doctors’ usage paths of mEHRs. First, the average numbers of log-ins per day and features used per log-in were examined over different specialties and positions. Second, the number of features used by each doctor was visualized via a heat map to provide an overview of mEHR usage across feature types and doctors’ specialties. Third, we conducted a path analysis via a Sankey diagram to describe main usage paths and association rule mining to find frequent paths in mEHR usage. Results: The physician group logged on most frequently, whereas the OHBP group logged on least frequently. In fact, the number of log-ins per day of residents in the physician group was 4.4 times higher than that of staff members in the other groups. The heat map visualization showed a visible difference among specialty groups. The physician group used more consultation-related features, whereas the surgeon group used more surgery-related features. Generally, 50% of the doctors spent about 15 seconds at a time when using mEHRs. In the Sankey diagram, the physician group showed diverse usage patterns with higher complexity compared with the other 2 groups; in particular, their paths contained more loops, which reflected repetitive checks on multiple patients. The most frequent path included inpatient summary, which means that most users stopped at the point of summary and did not proceed to view more details. Conclusions: The usage paths of mEHRs showed considerable differences among the specialty groups. Such differences can be accommodated into an mEHR design to enhance the efficiency of care. ©Ji Yeong Soh, Sang-Hyuk Jung, Won Chul Cha, Mira Kang, Dong Kyung Chang, Jaegon Jung, JeanHyoung Lee, Jong Soo Choi, Kyunga Kim.",Electronic health record; Mobile apps; Mobile electronic health record; Mobile health,,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

Gaps in the referral process lead to delays in patients’ access to care, negative patient experience, worse health outcomes, and increased operational costs. While implementation of standards-based electronic referral options can alleviate some of these inefficiencies, many referrals to tertiary and quaternary care centers continue to be sent via fax. Objective: We describe the design process and architecture for a software application that has been developed and deployed to optimize the referrals intake process by automating the processing and digitization of incoming specialty referral faxes, extracting key data elements and integrating them into the electronic health record (EHR), and organizing referrals. Methods: A human-centered design approach was used to identify and describe the inefficiencies in the external referral process at our large, urban tertiary care center. Referrals Automation, an application to convert referral faxes to digital referrals in the EHR, was conceptualized based on key stakeholder interviews and time and motion studies. This application was designed using Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technologies (SMART) and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) platforms to allow for adaptability into other healthcare organizations. Results: Referrals Automation software was developed as a healthcare information technology solution to streamline the fax to referral process. The application was implemented into several specialty clinics. Metrics were built-in to the applications to evaluate and guide the further iteration of these features. Conclusions: Referrals Automation will enhance the referrals process by further streamlining and organizing the patient referral process. © The Author(s) 2020.",Access to care; Application programming interface; HL7 FHIR; Referral; User-centered design,adult; article; automation; electronic health record; Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources; health care organization; human; information technology; interview; software; task performance; tertiary care center; universal design,Oxford University Press,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

To appreciate a vision for how LHS methods can optimize processes and outcomes in medical diagnosis (diagnostic excellence), we interviewed 32 individuals with relevant expertise: 18 who have studied diagnostic processes using traditional behavioral science and health services research methods, six focused on machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, and eight multidisciplinary researchers experienced in advocating for and incorporating LHS methods, ie, scalable continuous learning in health care. We report on barriers and facilitators, identified by these subjects, to applying their methods toward optimizing medical diagnosis. We then employ their insights to envision the emergence of a learning ecosystem that leverages the tools of each of the three research groups to advance diagnostic excellence. We found that these communities represent a natural fit forward, in which together, they can better measure diagnostic processes and close the loop of putting insights into practice. Members of the three academic communities will need to network and bring in additional stakeholders before they can design and implement the necessary infrastructure that would support ongoing learning of diagnostic processes at an economy of scale and scope. © 2019 The Authors.

With increased adoption of the electronic health record (EHR), genetic testing is increasingly resulted in the EHR. However, this leads to challenges in both storage and disclosure of genetic results, particularly when parental results are combined with child genetic results. Privacy and Ethical Considerations â Accidental disclosure and erroneous documentation of genetic results can occur due to the nature of their presentation in the EHR and documentation processes by clinicians. Genetic information is both sensitive and identifying, and requires a considered approach to both timing and extent of disclosure to families and access to clinicians. Methods â This article uses an interdisciplinary approach to explore ethical issues surrounding privacy, confidentiality of genetic data, and access to genetic results by health care providers and family members, and provides suggestions in a stakeholder format for best practices on this topic for clinicians and informaticians. Suggestions are made for clinicians on documenting and accessing genetic information in the EHR, and on collaborating with genetics specialists and disclosure of genetic results to families. Additional considerations for families including ethics around results of adolescents and special scenarios for blended families and foster minors are also provided. Finally, administrators and informaticians are provided best practices on both institutional processes and EHR architecture, including security and access control, with emphasis on the minimum necessary paradigm and parent/patient engagement and control of the use and disclosure of data. Conclusion â The authors hope that these best practices energize specialty societies to craft practice guidelines on genetic information management in the EHR with interdisciplinary input that addresses all stakeholder needs. © 2020 American Institute of Physics Inc..

Clinical and translational data warehouses, such as Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) and tranSMART, are important infrastructure components that provide users with unified access to the large heterogeneous data sets needed to realize this and support use cases such as cohort selection, hypothesis generation, and ad hoc data analysis. Objective: Often, different warehousing platforms are needed to support different use cases and different types of data. Moreover, to achieve an optimal data representation within the target systems, specific domain knowledge is needed when designing data-loading processes. Consequently, informaticians need to work closely with clinicians and researchers in short iterations. This is a challenging task as installing and maintaining warehousing platforms can be complex and time consuming. Furthermore, data loading typically requires significant effort in terms of data preprocessing, cleansing, and restructuring. The platform described in this study aims to address these challenges. Methods: We formulated system requirements to achieve agility in terms of platform management and data loading. The derived system architecture includes a cloud infrastructure with unified management interfaces for multiple warehouse platforms and a data-loading pipeline with a declarative configuration paradigm and meta-loading approach. The latter compiles data and configuration files into forms required by existing loading tools, thereby automating a wide range of data restructuring and cleansing tasks. We demonstrated the fulfillment of the requirements and the originality of our approach by an experimental evaluation and a comparison with previous work. Results: The platform supports both i2b2 and tranSMART with built-in security. Our experiments showed that the loading pipeline accepts input data that cannot be loaded with existing tools without preprocessing. Moreover, it lowered efforts significantly, reducing the size of configuration files required by factors of up to 22 for tranSMART and 1135 for i2b2. The time required to perform the compilation process was roughly equivalent to the time required for actual data loading. Comparison with other tools showed that our solution was the only tool fulfilling all requirements. Conclusions: Our platform significantly reduces the efforts required for managing clinical and translational warehouses and for loading data in various formats and structures, such as complex entity-attribute-value structures often found in laboratory data. Moreover, it facilitates the iterative refinement of data representations in the target platforms, as the required configuration files are very compact. The quantitative measurements presented are consistent with our experiences of significantly reduced efforts for building warehousing platforms in close cooperation with medical researchers. Both the cloud-based hosting infrastructure and the data-loading pipeline are available to the community as open source software with comprehensive documentation. © 2020 Helmut Spengler, Claudia Lang, Tanmaya Mahapatra, Ingrid Gatz, Klaus A Kuhn, Fabian Prasser.",Cohort selection; Data warehouse; Docker; Extract-transform-load; Hosting; Hypothesis generation; I2b2; Translational research; TranSMART,,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

Integrating prescription drug monitoring programs into electronic health records offers promise to improve opioid prescribing practices. This study aimed to evaluate 2 different user interface designs for prescription drug monitoring program and electronic health record integration. Materials and Methods: Twenty-four resident physicians participated in a randomized controlled experiment using 4 simulated patient cases. In the conventional condition, prescription opioid histories were presented in tabular format, and computerized clinical decision support (CDS) was provided via interruptive modal dialogs (ie, pop-ups). The alternative condition featured a graphical opioid history, a cue to visit that history, and noninterruptive CDS. Two attending pain specialists judged prescription appropriateness. Results: Participants in the alternative condition wrote more appropriate prescriptions. When asked after the experiment, most participants stated that they preferred the alternative design to the conventional design.

This implementation approach exacerbates the digital divide, with facilities in areas with inadequate electrical and network infrastructure often left behind. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies have been implemented to extend the reach of digital health, but these systems largely add to the problem of siloed patient data, with few seamlessly interoperating with the EHR systems that are now scaled nationally in many LMICs. Robust mHealth applications that effectively extend EHR systems are needed to improve access, improve quality of care, and ameliorate the digital divide. Objective: We report on the development and scaled implementation of mUzima, an mHealth extension of the most broadly deployed EHR system in LMICs (OpenMRS). Methods: The “Guidelines for reporting of health interventions using mobile phones: mobile (mHealth) evidence reporting assessment (mERA)” checklist was employed to report on the mUzima application. The World Health Organization (WHO) Principles for Digital Development framework was used as a secondary reference framework. Details of mUzima's architecture, core features, functionalities, and its implementation status are provided to highlight elements that can be adapted in other systems. Results: mUzima is an open-source, highly configurable Android application with robust features including offline management, deduplication, relationship management, security, cohort management, and error resolution, among many others. mUzima allows providers with lower-end Android smartphones (version 4.4 and above) who work remotely to access historical patient data, collect new data, view media, leverage decision support, conduct store-and-forward teleconsultation, and geolocate clients. The application is supported by an active community of developers and users, with feature priorities vetted by the community. mUzima has been implemented nationally in Kenya, is widely used in Rwanda, and is gaining scale in Uganda and Mozambique. It is disease-agnostic, with current use cases in HIV, cancer, chronic disease, and COVID-19 management, among other conditions. mUzima meets all WHO's Principles of Digital Development, and its scaled implementation success has led to its recognition as a digital global public good and its listing in the WHO Digital Health Atlas. Conclusions: Greater emphasis should be placed on mHealth applications that robustly extend reach of EHR systems within resource-limited settings, as opposed to siloed mHealth applications. This is particularly important given that health information exchange infrastructure is yet to mature in many LMICs. The mUzima application demonstrates how this can be done at scale, as evidenced by its adoption across multiple countries and for numerous care domains. © Martin Chieng Were, Simon Savai, Benard Mokaya, Samuel Mbugua, Nyoman Ribeka, Preetam Cholli, Ada Yeung.

Anecdotally, we know that EHR integration is a complex and time-consuming task; yet, the process has not been examined in detail. As part of an implementation project, we examined the work involved in integrating an encounter PDA for symptomatic uterine fibroids into Epic EHR systems. Objective: This study aims to identify the steps and time required to integrate a PDA into the Epic EHR system and examine facilitators and barriers to the integration effort. Methods: We conducted a case study at 5 academic medical centers in the United States. A clinical champion at each institution liaised with their Epic EHR team to initiate the integration of the uterine fibroid Option Grid PDAs into clinician-facing menus. We scheduled regular meetings with the Epic software analysts and an expert Epic technologist to discuss how best to integrate the tools into Epic for use by clinicians with patients. The meetings were then recorded and transcribed. Two researchers independently coded the transcripts and field notes before categorizing the codes and conducting a thematic analysis to identify the facilitators and barriers to EHR integration. The steps were reviewed and edited by an Epic technologist to ensure their accuracy. Results: Integrating the uterine fibroid Option Grid PDA into clinician-facing menus required an 18-month timeline and a 6-step process, as follows: task priority negotiation with Epic software teams, security risk assessment, technical review, Epic configuration; troubleshooting, and launch. The key facilitators of the process were the clinical champions who advocated for integration at the institutional level and the presence of an experienced technologist who guided Epic software analysts during the build. Another facilitator was the use of an emerging industry standard app platform (Health Level 7 Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technologies on Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) as a means of integrating the Option Grid into existing systems. This standard platform enabled clinicians to access the tools by using single sign-on credentials and prevented protected health information from leaving the EHR. Key barriers were the lack of control over the Option Grid product developed by EBSCO (Elton B Stephens Company) Health; the periodic Epic upgrades that can result in a pause on new software configurations; and the unforeseen software problems with Option Grid (ie, inability to print the PDA), which delayed the launch of the PDA. Conclusions: The integration of PDAs into the Epic EHR system requires a 6-step process and an 18-month timeline. The process required support and prioritization from a clinical champion, guidance from an experienced technologist, and a willing EHR software developer team. © Peter Scalia, Farhan Ahmad, Danielle Schubbe, Rachel Forcino, Marie-Anne Durand, Paul James Barr, Glyn Elwyn.

Drug-drug interaction (DDI) alerts often fail to account for factors that could reduce risk; further, drugs that trigger alerts are often inconsistently grouped into value sets. Toward improving the specificity of DDI alerts, the objectives of this study were to (1) highlight the inconsistency of drug value sets for triggering DDI alerts and (2) demonstrate a method of classifying factors that can be used to modify the risk of harm from a DDI. Methods: This was a proof-of-concept study focused on 15 well-known DDIs. Using 3 drug interaction references, we extracted 2 drug value sets and any available order- and patient-related factors for each DDI. Fleiss' kappa was used to measure the consistency of value sets among references. Risk-modifying factors were classified as order parameters (eg, route and dose) or patient characteristics (eg, comorbidities and laboratory results). Results: Seventeen value sets (56%) had nonsignificant agreement. Agreement among the remaining 13 value sets was on average moderate. Thirty-three factors that could reduce risk in 14 of 15 DDIs (93%) were identified. Most risk-modifying factors (67%) were classified as order parameters. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the importance of increasing the consistency of drug value sets that trigger DDI alerts and how alert specificity and usefulness can be improved with risk-modifying factors obtained from drug references.

The HL7 CDS Hooks standard was developed in part for this purpose. The objective of this study was to determine if contextually relevant CDS Hooks prompts can increase utilization of a SMART on FHIR medical reference app (MDCalc for EHR). Materials and Methods: We conducted a 7-month, provider-randomized trial with 70 providers in a single emergency department. The intervention was a collection of CDS Hooks prompts suggesting the use of 6 medical calculators in a SMART on FHIR medical reference app. The primary outcome was the percentage of provider-patient interactions in which the app was used to view a recommended calculator. Secondary outcomes were app usage stratified by individual calculators. Results: Intervention group providers viewed a study calculator in the app in 6.0% of interactions compared to 2.6% in the control group (odds ratio = 2.45, 95% CI, 1.2-5.2, P value. 02), an increase of 130%. App use was significantly greater for 2 of 6 calculators. Discussion and Conclusion: Contextually relevant CDS Hooks prompts led to a significant increase in SMART on FHIR app utilization. This demonstrates the potential of using CDS Hooks to guide appropriate use of SMART on FHIR apps and was a primary motivation for the development of the standard. Future research may evaluate potential impacts on clinical care decisions and outcomes.  © 2022 The Author(s).

389,Frid S.; Fuentes Expósito M.A.; Grau-Corral I.; Amat-Fernandez C.; Muñoz Mateu M.; Pastor Duran X.; Lozano-Rubí R.,Successful Integration of EN/ISO 13606–Standardized Extracts from a Patient Mobile App into an Electronic Health Record: Description of a Methodology,2022,JMIR Medical Informatics,8.0,10.2196/40344,"Background: There is an increasing need to integrate patient-generated health data (PGHD) into health information systems (HISs). The use of health information standards based on the dual model allows the achievement of semantic interoperability among systems. Although there is evidence in the use of the Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technologies on Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (SMART on FHIR) framework for standardized communication between mobile apps and electronic health records (EHRs), the use of European Norm/International Organization for Standardization (EN/ISO) 13606 has not been explored yet, despite some advantages over FHIR in terms of modeling and formalization of clinical knowledge, as well as flexibility in the creation of new concepts. Objective: This study aims to design and implement a methodology based on the dual-model paradigm to communicate clinical information between a patient mobile app (Xemio Research) and an institutional ontology-based clinical repository (OntoCR) without loss of meaning. Methods: This paper is framed within Artificial intelligence Supporting CAncer Patients across Europe (ASCAPE), a project that aims to use artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) mechanisms to support cancer patients’ health status and quality of life (QoL). First, the variables “side effect” and “daily steps” were defined and represented with EN/ISO 13606 archetypes. Next, ontologies that model archetyped concepts and map them to the standard were created and uploaded to OntoCR, where they were ready to receive instantiated patient data. Xemio Research used a conversion module in the ASCAPE Local Edge to transform data entered into the app to create EN/ISO 13606 extracts, which were sent to an Application Programming Interface (API) in OntoCR that maps each element in the normalized XML files to its corresponding location in the ontology. This way, instantiated data of patients are stored in the clinical repository. Results: Between December 22, 2020, and April 4, 2022, 1100 extracts of 47 patients were successfully communicated (234/1100, 21.3%, extracts of side effects and 866/1100, 78.7%, extracts of daily activity). Furthermore, the creation of EN/ISO 13606–standardized archetypes allows the reuse of clinical information regarding daily activity and side effects, while with the creation of ontologies, we extended the knowledge representation of our clinical repository. Conclusions: Health information interoperability is one of the requirements for continuity of health care. The dual model allows the separation of knowledge and information in HISs. EN/ISO 13606 was chosen for this project because of the operational mechanisms it offers for data exchange, as well as its flexibility for modeling knowledge and creating new concepts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experience reported in the literature of effective communication of EN/ISO 13606 EHR extracts between a patient mobile app and an institutional clinical repository using a scalable standard-agnostic methodology that can be applied to other projects, data sources, and institutions. ©Santiago Frid, Maria Angeles Fuentes Expósito, Inmaculada Grau-Corral, Clara Amat-Fernandez, Montserrat Muñoz Mateu, Xavier Pastor Duran, Raimundo Lozano-Rubí.",artificial intelligence; electronic health records; health information interoperability; health information standards; machine learning; mobile app,,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

The software is to be plugged into a modern hospital domain, where electronic patient records are used to handle the entire patient’s history. Most research institutes follow the same procedures to build study cohorts, but mainly in a non-standardized and repetitive way. As a result, researchers spend time writing boilerplate code, which could be used for more challenging tasks. Methods: The package can improve and simplify existing processes in the clinical research environment. It collects all needed functionalities into a straightforward interface that can be used to query a FHIR server, download imaging studies and filter clinical documents. The full capacity of the search mechanism of the FHIR REST API is available to the user, leading to a uniform querying process for all resources, thus simplifying the customization of each use case. Additionally, valuable features like parallelization and filtering are included to make it more performant. Results: As an exemplary practical application, the package can be used to analyze the prognostic significance of routine CT imaging and clinical data in breast cancer with tumor metastases in the lungs. In this example, the initial patient cohort is first collected using ICD-10 codes. For these patients, the survival information is also gathered. Some additional clinical data is retrieved, and CT scans of the thorax are downloaded. Finally, the survival analysis can be computed using a deep learning model with the CT scans, the TNM staging and positivity of relevant markers as input. This process may vary depending on the FHIR server and available clinical data, and can be customized to cover even more use cases. Conclusions: FHIR-PYrate opens up the possibility to quickly and easily retrieve FHIR data, download image data, and search medical documents for keywords within a Python package. With the demonstrated functionality, FHIR-PYrate opens an easy way to assemble research collectives automatically. © 2023, The Author(s).",Dataframe; Dicom; Electronic patient record; FHIR; Information extraction; Python,"Data Science; Electronic Health Records; Health Level Seven; Humans; Software; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; data science; electronic health record; health level 7; human; software; x-ray computed tomography",BioMed Central Ltd,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

However, a gapless implementation of guideline recommendations requires health care personnel not only to be aware of the recommendations and to support their content but also to recognize every situation in which they are applicable. To not miss situations in which recommendations should be applied, computerized clinical decision support can be provided through a system that allows an automated monitoring of adherence to clinical guideline recommendations in individual patients. Objective: This study aims to collect and analyze the requirements for a system that allows the monitoring of adherence to evidence-based clinical guideline recommendations in individual patients and, based on these requirements, to design and implement a software prototype that integrates guideline recommendations with individual patient data, and to demonstrate the prototype’s utility in treatment recommendations. Methods: We performed a work process analysis with experienced intensive care clinicians to develop a conceptual model of how to support guideline adherence monitoring in clinical routine and identified which steps in the model could be supported electronically. We then identified the core requirements of a software system to support recommendation adherence monitoring in a consensus-based requirements analysis within the loosely structured focus group work of key stakeholders (clinicians, guideline developers, health data engineers, and software developers). On the basis of these requirements, we designed and implemented a modular system architecture. To demonstrate its utility, we applied the prototype to monitor adherence to a COVID-19 treatment recommendation using clinical data from a large European university hospital. Results: We designed a system that integrates guideline recommendations with real-time clinical data to evaluate individual guideline recommendation adherence and developed a functional prototype. The needs analysis with clinical staff resulted in a flowchart describing the work process of how adherence to recommendations should be monitored. Four core requirements were identified: the ability to decide whether a recommendation is applicable and implemented for a specific patient, the ability to integrate clinical data from different data formats and data structures, the ability to display raw patient data, and the use of a Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources–based format for the representation of clinical practice guidelines to provide an interoperable, standards-based guideline recommendation exchange format. Conclusions: Our system has advantages in terms of individual patient treatment and quality management in hospitals. However, further studies are needed to measure its impact on patient outcomes and evaluate its resource effectiveness in different clinical settings. We specified a modular software architecture that allows experts from different fields to work independently and focus on their area of expertise. We have released the source code of our system under an open-source license and invite for collaborative further development of the system. ©Gregor Lichtner, Claudia Spies, Carlo Jurth, Thomas Bienert, Anika Mueller, Oliver Kumpf, Vanessa Piechotta, Nicole Skoetz, Monika Nothacker, Martin Boeker, Joerg J Meerpohl, Falk von Dincklage.",clinical; clinical decision support; clinical guideline recommendations; computer-interpretable guidelines; COVID-19; data; evidence-based medicine; monitoring; patient; prototype; system; utility,COVID-19; COVID-19 Drug Treatment; Focus Groups; Guideline Adherence; Humans; Article; automation; clinical decision support system; clinician; conceptual model; consensus; coronavirus disease 2019; data protection; electronic health record; evidence based medicine; evidence based practice; Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources; health data; human; intensivist; medical society; medical staff; openEHR; patient coding; practice guideline; process model; protocol compliance; software design; standardization; total quality management; university hospital; coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19 pharmacotherapy; information processing; protocol compliance,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

Here, we describe efforts towards a new paradigm in genomics-electronic health record (HER) integration, using a standardized suite of FHIR Genomics Operations that encapsulates the complexity of molecular data so that precision medicine solution developers can focus on building applications. Materials and Methods: FHIR Genomics Operations essentially ""wrap""a genomics data repository, presenting a uniform interface to applications. More importantly, operations encapsulate the complexity of data within a repository and normalize redundant data representations-particularly relevant in genomics, where a tremendous amount of raw data exists in often-complex non-FHIR formats. Results: Fifteen FHIR Genomics Operations have been developed, designed to support a wide range of clinical scenarios, such as variant discovery; clinical trial matching; hereditary condition and pharmacogenomic screening; and variant reanalysis. Operations are being matured through the HL7 balloting process, connectathons, pilots, and the HL7 FHIR Accelerator program. Discussion: Next-generation sequencing can identify thousands to millions of variants, whose clinical significance can change over time as our knowledge evolves. To manage such a large volume of dynamic and complex data, new models of genomics-EHR integration are needed. Qualitative observations to date suggest that freeing application developers from the need to understand the nuances of genomic data, and instead base applications on standardized APIs can not only accelerate integration but also dramatically expand the applications of Omic data in driving precision care at scale for all.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Materials and Methods: We developed CDS to support care of newly arrived refugees through a systematic process including a needs assessment, a 2-phase cognitive task analysis, structured preimplementation testing, local implementation, and staged dissemination. We sought consensus from prospective users on CDS scope, applicable content, basic supported workflows, and final structure. We documented processes and developed sharable artifacts from each phase of development. We publically shared CDS artifacts through online dissemination platforms. We collected feedback and implementation data from implementation sites. Results: Responses from 19 organizations demonstrated a need for improved CDS for newly arrived refugee patients. A guided multicenter workflow analysis identified 2 main workflows used by organizations that would need to be supported by shared CDS. We developed CDS through an iterative design process, which was successfully disseminated to other sites using online dissemination repositories. Implementation sites had a small-to-modest analyst time commitment but reported a good match between CDS and workflow. Conclusion: Sharing of CDS requires overcoming technical and workflow barriers. We used a guided multicenter workflow analysis and online dissemination repositories to create flexible CDS that has been adapted at 3 sites. Organizations looking to develop sharable CDS should consider evaluating the workflows of multiple institutions and collecting feedback on scope, design, and content in order to make a more generalizable product. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Annual Symposium proceedings. AMIA Symposium,9.0,,"SMART on FHIR applications are standards-based tools integrated with electronic health record (EHR) systems and intended for dissemination across EHR platforms. A key challenge for disseminating many apps is that EHR vendors provide different levels of support for FHIR. Thus, app developers must balance functionality versus portability. In this case study, a feature-rich app for neonatal bilirubin management was developed prioritizing physician-requested functionality, with custom FHIR interfaces implemented within the EHR as needed. Following wide intra-institutional use, several approaches are being pursued for adapting the app for cross-institutional dissemination: user surveys and interviews to identify least-valued app features which could potentially be omitted; enabling the application to provide differential features depending on available EHR FHIR capabilities; replacing custom FHIR interfaces with native EHR FHIR interfaces as they became available; and using a canonical logical data model known as QUICK that can be mapped to different FHIR versions and profiles. ©2019 AMIA - All rights reserved.",,"Academic Medical Centers; Bilirubin; Electronic Health Records; Health Information Interoperability; Health Level Seven; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Medical Records Systems, Computerized; Organizational Case Studies; Software; Utah; bilirubin; blood; data interoperability; electronic health record; electronic medical record system; health level 7; health services research; human; newborn; software; university hospital; Utah",NLM (Medline),,,,Article,Final,

Two international workshops, one conducted in June 2019 in Cordoba, Spain, and one in October 2019 in Athens, Greece, were organized by four Horizon 2020 (H2020) European Union (EU)-funded projects: BOUNCE, CATCH ITN, DESIREE, and MyPal. The issues covered included patient engagement, knowledge and data-driven decision support systems, patient journey, rehabilitation, personalized diagnosis, trust, assessment of guidelines, and interoperability of information and communication technology (ICT) platforms. A series of recommendations was provided as the complex landscape of data-driven technical innovation in cancer care was portrayed. Objective: This study aims to provide information on the current state of the art of technology and data-driven innovations for the management of cancer care through the work of four EU H2020-funded projects. Methods: Two international workshops on ICT in the management of cancer care were held, and several topics were identified through discussion among the participants. A focus group was formulated after the second workshop, in which the status of technological and data-driven cancer management as well as the challenges, opportunities, and recommendations in this area were collected and analyzed. Results: Technical and data-driven innovations provide promising tools for the management of cancer care. However, several challenges must be successfully addressed, such as patient engagement, interoperability of ICT-based systems, knowledge management, and trust. This paper analyzes these challenges, which can be opportunities for further research and practical implementation and can provide practical recommendations for future work. Conclusions: Technology and data-driven innovations are becoming an integral part of cancer care management. In this process, specific challenges need to be addressed, such as increasing trust and engaging the whole stakeholder ecosystem, to fully benefit from these innovations. © Haridimos Kondylakis, Cristian Axenie, Dhundy (Kiran) Bastola, Dimitrios G Katehakis, Angelina Kouroubali, Daria Kurz, Nekane Larburu, Iván Macía, Roma Maguire, Christos Maramis, Kostas Marias, Philip Morrow, Naiara Muro, Francisco José Núñez-Benjumea, Andrik Rampun, Octavio Rivera-Romero, Bryan Scotney, Gabriel Signorelli, Hui Wang, Manolis Tsiknakis, Reyer Zwiggelaar.

A new collective intelligence, incorporating human and artificial intelligence (AI) could overcome these obstacles. Because AI will play a key role in this new collective intelligence, it is necessary that those involved in healthcare have a general knowledge of how these technologies work. With this comprehensive review, we intend to provide it. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A broad-ranging search has been undertaken on institutional and non-institutional websites in order to identify relevant papers, comments and reports. RESULTS: We firstly describe the flaws and defects of the current R&D biomedical model and how the generation of a new collective intelligence will result in a better and wiser medicine through a truly personalized and holistic approach. We, then, discuss the new forms of data collection and data processing and the different types of artificial learning and their specific algorithms. Finally, we review the current uses and applications of AI in the biomedical field and how these can be expanded, as well as the limitations and challenges of applying these new technologies in the medical field. CONCLUSIONS: This colossal common effort based on a new collective intelligence will exponentially improve the quality of medical research, resulting in a radical change for the better in the healthcare model.

We applied the newly created PRO standards from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology to facilitate the collection and integration of standardized PRO data. A novel multitiered architecture was created to enable seamless integration of PRO data via Substitutable Medical Apps and Reusable Technologies on Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources apps and scaled to different EHR platforms in multiple ambulatory settings. Materials and Methods: We used a standards-based approach to deploy 2 apps that source and surface PRO data in real-time for provider use within the EHR and which rely on PRO assessments from an external center to streamline app and EHR integration. Results: The apps were developed to enable patients to answer validated assessments (eg, a Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System including using a Computer Adaptive Test format). Both apps were developed to populate the EHR in real time using the Health Level Seven FHIR standard allowing providers to view patients' data during the clinical encounter. The process of implementing this architecture with 2 different apps across 18 ambulatory care sites and 3 different EHR platforms is described. Conclusion: Our approach and solution proved feasible, secure, and time- and resource-efficient. We offer actionable guidance for this technology to be scaled and adapted to promote adoption in diverse ambulatory care settings and across different EHRs. © 2021 The Author(s).",data standards; electronic health record; HL7 FHIR; interoperability; patient generated health data; patient-reported outcomes,Electronic Health Records; Health Level Seven; Humans; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Software; ambulatory care; Article; clinical assessment; electronic health record; Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources; health level 7; human; major clinical study; outcome assessment; patient-reported outcome; health level 7; patient-reported outcome; software,Oxford University Press,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access

Summarize HIE-associated literature for most frequently occurring topics, as well as within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and health equity. Finally, provide recommendations for how HIE can advance the vision of a digital healthcare ecosystem. Methods: A computer program was developed to mediate a literature search of primary literature indexed in MEDLINE that was: (1) indexed with Health Information Exchange MeSH descriptor as a major topic; and (2) published between January 2018 and December 2021. Frequency of MeSH descriptors was then used to identify and to rank topics associated with the retrieved literature. COVID-19 literature was identified using the general COVID-19 PubMed Clinical Query filter. Health equity literature was identified using additional MeSH descriptor-based searches. The retrieved literature was then reviewed and summarized. Results: A total of 256 articles were retrieved and reviewed for this survey. The major thematic areas summarized were: (1) Information Dissemination; (2) Delivery of Health Care; (3) Hospitals; (4) Hospital Emergency Service; (5) COVID-19; (6) Health Disparities; and (7) Computer Security and Confidentiality. A common theme across all areas examined for this survey was the maturity of HIE to support data-driven healthcare delivery. Recommendations were developed based on opportunities identified across the reviewed literature. Conclusions: HIE is an essential advance in next generation healthcare delivery. The review of the recent literature (2018-2021) indicates that successful HIE improves healthcare delivery, often resulting in improved health outcomes. There remain major opportunities for expanded use of HIE, including the active engagement of clinical and patient stakeholders.

The ELICIT framework recommends 12 evaluation steps: (1) business case assessment; (2) stakeholder requirements gathering; (3) technical requirements gathering; (4) technical acceptability assessment; (5) user acceptability assessment; (6) social acceptability assessment; (7) social implementation assessment; (8) initial user satisfaction assessment; (9) technical implementation assessment; (10) technical portability assessment; (11) long-term user satisfaction assessment; and (12) social outcomes assessment. Discussion: Effective evaluation requires a shared understanding and collaboration across disciplines throughout the entire IT life cycle. In contrast with previous evaluation frameworks, the ELICIT framework focuses on all phases of the IT life cycle across the society, user, and IT levels. Institutions seeking to establish evaluation programs for EHR-integrated innovations could use our framework to create such shared understanding and justify the need to invest in evaluation. Conclusion: As health care undergoes a digital transformation, it will be critical for EHR-integrated innovations to be systematically evaluated. The ELICIT framework can facilitate these evaluations. © 2022 The Author(s)",Clinical decision support; Evaluation framework; Health information technology; Health technology assessment; Human factors engineering; Implementation science,Commerce; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Information Technology; Medical Informatics; Technology; Decision support systems; Health care; Human engineering; Social sciences computing; Software testing; Business case; Clinical decision support; Evaluation framework; Health information technology; Health informations; Health technology assessments; Human factor engineerings; Implementation science; Information technology frameworks; Technology life cycle; article; biomedical technology assessment; consensus; decision support system; electronic health record; human; human experiment; implementation science; information technology; life cycle; medical informatics; outcome assessment; satisfaction; social acceptance; sociology; software; commercial phenomena; technology; Life cycle,Academic Press Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access

With the advent of the Big Data era, various companies and organizations urgently need data from other parties for data analysis and mining to provide better services. Therefore, data sharing and data exchange have become an enormous industry. Traditional centralized data platforms face many problems, such as privacy leakage, high transaction costs and lack of interoperability. Introducing blockchain into this field can address these problems, while providing decentralized data storage and exchange, access control, identity authentication and copyright protection. Although many impressive blockchain-based schemes for data sharing or data exchange scenarios have been presented in recent years, there is still a lack of review and summary of work in this area. In this paper, we conduct a detailed survey of blockchain-based data sharing and data exchange platforms, discussing the latest technical architectures and research results in this field. In particular, we first survey the current blockchain-based data sharing solutions and provide a detailed analysis of system architecture, access control, interoperability, and security. We then review blockchain-based data exchange systems and data marketplaces, discussing trading process, monetization, copyright protection and other related topics.  © 2023 IEEE.",Big Data; Blockchain; data exchange; data sharing,Access control; Big data; Blockchain; Commerce; Copyrights; Cryptography; Digital storage; Electronic data interchange; Interoperability; Block-chain; Centralised; Consensus protocols; Copyright protections; Data platform; Data Sharing; Decentralisation; Energy; Privacy leakages; Smart contract,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,,Article,Final,

Many patients who develop Platelet Transfusion Refractoriness (PTR) require HLA-matched platelets. Identifying these patients early could lead to better utilization of platelets as well as increased platelet counts. We built a SMART on FHIR visualization tool to aid the oncology, blood bank, and blood donor center teams in identifying these patients by showing trends in thrombocytopenia along with a computer generated calculated Panel Reactive Antibody (cPRA) level. To do this, we required a FHIR interface to our HLA database. We describe our methods and outcome for constructing this FHIR interface, as well as the architecture and data flow of HLA data from its proprietary database to the SMART on FHIR environment and application database along with RESTful cPRA web service calculator. Future work will evaluate the clinical impact of this platelet visualization tool and overall success of our FHIR implementation. © Schattauer 2017.",FHIR; HLA antigens; Laboratory information systems; Platelet transfusion; Standards,"Databases, Factual; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; HLA Antigens; Humans; Platelet Transfusion; User-Computer Interface; HLA antigen; clinical decision support system; computer interface; factual database; human; metabolism; thrombocyte transfusion",Schattauer GmbH,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access

This brings several challenges as processing the documents on a large scale takes a toll on the infrastructure. The complexity of these documents compounds the issue of handling them which is why applying big data techniques is necessary. The nature of big data techniques can trigger accuracy/semantic loss in health documents when they are partitioned for processing. This semantic loss is critical with respect to clinical use as well as insurance, or medical education. Methods: In this paper we propose a novel technique to avoid any semantic loss that happens during the conventional partitioning of healthcare documents in big data through a constraint model based on the conformance of clinical document standard and user based use cases. We used clinical document architecture (CDAR) datasets on Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) through uniquely configured setup. We identified the affected documents with respect to semantic loss after partitioning and separated them into two sets: conflict free documents and conflicted documents. The resolution for conflicted documents was done based on different resolution strategies that were mapped according to CDAR specification. The first part of the technique is focused in identifying the type of conflict in the blocks that arises after partitioning. The second part focuses on the resolution mapping of the conflicts based on the constraints applied depending on the validation and user scenario. Results: We used a publicly available dataset of CDAR documents, identified all conflicted documents and resolved all the them successfully to avoid any semantic loss. In our experiment we tested up to 87,000 CDAR documents and successfully identified the conflicts and resolved the semantic issues. Conclusion: We have presented a novel study that focuses on the semantics of big data which did not compromise the performance and resolved the semantic issues risen during the processing of clinical documents. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Big data; CDA<sup>®</sup> documents; Clinical documents; Document handling; Semantics,Big Data; Delivery of Health Care; Semantics; Big data; File organization; Health care; Medical education; Clinical document architectures; Clinical documents; Different resolutions; Document handling; Document standards; Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS); Novel techniques; Semantic preservation; article; big data; human; human experiment; insurance; medical education; semantics; validation process; health care delivery; Semantics,Elsevier Ireland Ltd,,,,Article,Final,

Shareable electronic clinical decision support (CDS) could improve lead screening and management. However, discrepancies between federal, state and local recommendations could present significant challenges for implementation. Methods: We identified publically available guidance on lead screening and management. We extracted definitions for elevated lead and recommendations for screening, follow-up, reporting, and management. We compared thresholds and level of obligation for management actions. Finally, we assessed the feasibility of development of shareable CDS. Results: We identified 54 guidance sources. States offered different definitions of elevated lead, and recommendations for screening, reporting, follow-up and management. Only 37 of 48 states providing guidance used the Center for Disease Control (CDC) definition for elevated lead. There were 17 distinct management actions. Guidance sources indicated an average of 5.5 management actions, but offered different criteria and levels of obligation for these actions. Despite differences, the recommendations were well-structured, actionable, and encodable, indicating shareable CDS is feasible. Conclusion: Current variability across guidance poses challenges for clinicians. Developing shareable CDS is feasible and could improve pediatric lead screening and management. Shareable CDS would need to account for local variability in guidance. © 2020 The Author(s).",Clinical decision support; Geographic variation in care; Lead poisoning; Lead Screening,"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.; Child, Preschool; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Feasibility Studies; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Infant; Lead Poisoning; Mass Screening; Practice Guidelines as Topic; United States; clinical decision support system; feasibility study; health care disparity; human; infant; lead poisoning; mass screening; organization and management; practice guideline; preschool child; United States",BioMed Central Ltd.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

We applied informatics methods from expert suggestion systems to a challenging clinical problem: generating personalized nutrition goals from patient-generated diet and blood glucose data. Materials and methods: We applied qualitative process coding and decision tree modeling to understand how registered dietitians translate patient-generated data into recommendations for dietary self-management of diabetes (i.e., knowledge model). We encoded this process in a set of functions that take diet and blood glucose data as an input and output diet recommendations (i.e., inference engine). Dietitians assessed face validity. Using four patient datasets, we compared our inference engine's output to clinical narratives and gold standards developed by expert clinicians. Results: To dietitians, the knowledge model represented how recommendations from patient data are made. Inference engine recommendations were 63 % consistent with the gold standard (range = 42 %–75 %) and 74 % consistent with narrative clinical observations (range = 63 %–83 %). Discussion: Qualitative modeling and automating how dietitians reason over patient data resulted in a knowledge model representing clinical knowledge. However, our knowledge model was less consistent with gold standard than narrative clinical recommendations, raising questions about how best to evaluate approaches that integrate patient-generated data with expert knowledge. Conclusion: New informatics approaches that integrate data-driven methods with expert decision making for personalized goal setting, such as the knowledge base and inference engine presented here, demonstrate the potential to extend the reach of patient-generated data by synthesizing it with clinical knowledge. However, important questions remain about the strengths and weaknesses of computer algorithms developed to discern signal from patient-generated data compared to human experts. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Expert system; Knowledge representation; Patient-generated health data; Personalized nutrition; Suggestion system,"Algorithms; Blood Glucose; Diabetes Mellitus; Diet; Expert Systems; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Nutritional Status; Nutritionists; Patient Care Team; Pilot Projects; Self-Management; Blood; Decision making; Decision trees; Engines; Glucose; Hospital data processing; Knowledge based systems; Medical computing; Nutrition; Trees (mathematics); glucose; Clinical knowledge; Clinical observation; Clinical problems; Computational approach; Data-driven methods; Decision tree modeling; Qualitative process; Self-monitoring technology; Article; blood glucose monitoring; decision tree; diet; dietitian; glucose blood level; goal attainment; human; knowledge base; macronutrient; meal; nutritional counseling; personalized nutrition; pilot study; practice guideline; priority journal; professional knowledge; self care; algorithm; attitude to health; diabetes mellitus; diet; expert system; nutritional status; organization and management; patient care; self care; Population statistics",Elsevier Ireland Ltd,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access

A growing number of FHIR-based clinical genomics applications are emerging. Here, we describe an open source utility for converting variants from VCF format into HL7 FHIR format. Results: vcf2fhir converts VCF variants into a FHIR Genomics Diagnostic Report. Conversion translates each VCF row into a corresponding FHIR-formatted variant in the generated report. In scope are simple variants (SNVs, MNVs, Indels), along with zygosity and phase relationships, for autosomes, sex chromosomes, and mitochondrial DNA. Input parameters include VCF file and genome build (‘GRCh37’ or ‘GRCh38’); and optionally a conversion region that indicates the region(s) to convert, a studied region that lists genomic regions studied by the lab, and a non-callable region that lists studied regions deemed uncallable by the lab. Conversion can be limited to a subset of VCF by supplying genomic coordinates of the conversion region(s). If studied and non-callable regions are also supplied, the output FHIR report will include ‘region-studied’ observations that detail which portions of the conversion region were studied, and of those studied regions, which portions were deemed uncallable. We illustrate the vcf2fhir utility via two case studies. The first, 'SMART Cancer Navigator', is a web application that offers clinical decision support by linking patient EHR information to cancerous gene variants. The second, 'Precision Genomics Integration Platform', intersects a patient's FHIR-formatted clinical and genomic data with knowledge bases in order to provide on-demand delivery of contextually relevant genomic findings and recommendations to the EHR. Conclusions: Experience to date shows that the vcf2fhir utility can be effectively woven into clinically useful genomic-EHR integration pipelines. Additional testing will be a critical step towards the clinical validation of this utility, enabling it to be integrated in a variety of real world data flow scenarios. For now, we propose the use of this utility primarily to accelerate FHIR Genomics understanding and to facilitate experimentation with further integration of genomics data into the EHR. © 2021, The Author(s).",Clinical genomics; EHR integration; FHIR; Next-generation sequencing; SMART-on-FHIR,"Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Electronic Health Records; Genomics; Humans; Knowledge Bases; Oncogenes; Decision support systems; Genes; Integration; Clinical decision support; Clinical Genomics; Clinical validations; Diagnostic Report; Electronic health record; Integration platform; Next-generation sequencing; Phase relationships; clinical decision support system; electronic health record; genomics; human; knowledge base; oncogene; Data integration",BioMed Central Ltd,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

Minimal information models have been used in other communities to establish community consensus around simple models capable of communicating useful information. This paper reports on a new minimal information model for describing potential drug-drug interactions. A task force of the Semantic Web in Health Care and Life Sciences Community Group of the World-Wide Web consortium engaged informaticians and drug-drug interaction experts in in-depth examination of recent literature and specific potential interactions. A consensus set of information items was identified, along with example descriptions of selected potential drug-drug interactions (PDDIs). User profiles and use cases were developed to demonstrate the applicability of the model. Ten core information items were identified: drugs involved, clinical consequences, seriousness, operational classification statement, recommended action, mechanism of interaction, contextual information/modifying factors, evidence about a suspected drug-drug interaction, frequency of exposure, and frequency of harm to exposed persons. Eight best practice recommendations suggest how PDDI knowledge artifact creators can best use the 10 information items when synthesizing drug interaction evidence into artifacts intended to aid clinicians. This model has been included in a proposed implementation guide developed by the HL7 Clinical Decision Support Workgroup and in PDDIs published in the CDS Connect repository.

Materials and Methods: A total of 49 primary data parameters were collected from July 2018 to May 2020 from eight level-III NICUs. From a total of 1546 patients, 757 patients were found to contain sufficient fixed, intermittent, and continuous data to create HDPs. Two different predictive models utilizing the HDP, one a logistic regression model (LRM) and the other a deep learning long–short-term memory (LSTM) model, were constructed to predict neonatal mortality at multiple time points during the patient hospitalization. The results were compared with previous illness severity scores, including SNAPPE, SNAPPE-II, CRIB, and CRIB-II. Results: A HDP matrix, including 12 221 536 minutes of patient stay in NICU, was constructed. The LRM model and the LSTM model performed better than existing neonatal illness severity scores in predicting mortality using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) metric. An ablation study showed that utilizing continuous parameters alone results in an AUC score of >80% for both LRM and LSTM, but combining fixed, intermittent, and continuous parameters in the HDP results in scores >85%. The probability of mortality predictive score has recall and precision of 0.88 and 0.77 for the LRM and 0.97 and 0.85 for the LSTM. Conclusions and Relevance: The HDP data structure supports multiple analytic techniques, including the statistical LRM approach and the machine learning LSTM approach used in this study. LRM and LSTM predictive models of neonatal mortality utilizing the HDP performed better than existing neonatal illness severity scores. © The Author(s) 2021.",,article; controlled study; deep learning; female; hospitalization; human; major clinical study; male; neonatal intensive care unit; newborn; newborn mortality; phenotype; prediction; probability; recall; receiver operating characteristic; short term memory; time series analysis; validation process,Oxford University Press,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

EHR systems are responsible for a growing number of vital functions for hospitals and providers. More recently, patient-facing EHR tools are allowing patients to interact with their EHR and connect external sources of health data, such as wearable fitness trackers, personal genomics, and outside health services, to it. As patients become more engaged with their EHR, the volume and variety of digital health information will serve an increasingly useful role in health care and health research. Particularly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ability for the biomedical research community to pivot to fully remote research, driven largely by EHR data capture and other digital health tools, is an exciting development that can significantly reduce burden on study participants, improve diversity in clinical research, and equip researchers with more robust clinical data. In this viewpoint, we describe how patient engagement with EHR technology is poised to advance the digital clinical trial space, an innovative research model that is uniquely accessible and inclusive for study participants. © 2022 The authors.",biomedical research; digital clinical trial; digital health technology; EHR; electronic health record; underrepresentation; underrepresented in biomedical research,,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

We previously developed a CDSS to automatically provide follow-up recommendations based on the American Society of Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) guidelines for women with both previously normal and abnormal test results leveraging information available in the electronic medical record (EMR). Objective Enhance the CDSS by improving its accuracy and incorporating changes to reflect the latest revision of the guidelines. Methods After making enhancements to the CDSS, we evaluated the performance of the clinical recommendations on 393 patients selected through stratified sampling from a set of 3,704 patients in a nonclinical setting. We performed chart review of individual patient's record to evaluate the performance of the system. An expert clinician assisted by a resident manually reviewed the recommendation made by the system and verified whether the recommendations were as per the ASCCP guidelines. Results The recommendation accuracy of the enhanced CDSS improved to 93%, which is a substantial improvement over the 84% reported previously. A detailed analysis of errors is presented in this article. We fixed the errors identified in this evaluation that were amenable to correction to further improve the accuracy of the system. The source code of the updated CDSS is available at https://github.com/ohnlp/MayoNlpPapCdss. Conclusion We made substantial enhancements to our earlier prototype CDSS with the updated ASCCP guidelines and performed a thorough evaluation in a nonclinical setting to improve the accuracy of the CDSS.

In the fuzzy collaborative approach, each decision maker first applies the alpha-cut operations method to derive the fuzzy weights of the criteria. Then, fuzzy intersection is applied to aggregate the fuzzy weights derived by all decision makers to measure the prior consensus among them. The fuzzy intersection results are then presented to the decision makers so that they can subjectively modify the pairwise comparison results to bring them closer to the fuzzy intersection results. Thereafter, the consensus among decision makers is again measured. The collaboration process will stop when no more modifications are made by any decision maker. Finally, the fuzzy weighted mean-centroid defuzzification method is applied to assess the suitability of a smart health practice. The fuzzy collaborative approach and some existing methods have been applied to assess the suitabilities of eleven smart health practices for a comparison. Among the compared practices, only the fuzzy collaborative approach could guarantee the existence of a full consensus among decision makers after the collaboration process, i.e., that the assessment results were acceptable to all decision makers. © 2019 by the authors.",Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process; Fuzzy collaborative intelligence; Smart health; Suitability,,MDPI AG,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

Our objective was to compare adverse drug event (ADE) rates determined from two RWD sources, electronic health records and administrative claims data, among children treated with drugs for pulmonary hypertension. Materials and Methods: Textual mentions of medications and signs/symptoms that may represent ADEs were identified in clinical notes using natural language processing. Diagnostic codes for the same signs/symptoms were identified in our electronic data warehouse for the patients with textual evidence of taking pulmonary hypertension-targeted drugs. We compared rates of ADEs identified in clinical notes to those identified from diagnostic code data. In addition, we compared putative ADE rates from clinical notes to those from a healthcare claims dataset from a large, national insurer. Results: Analysis of clinical notes identified up to 7-fold higher ADE rates than those ascertained from diagnostic codes. However, certain ADEs (eg, hearing loss) were more often identified in diagnostic code data. Similar results were found when ADE rates ascertained from clinical notes and national claims data were compared. Discussion: While administrative claims and clinical notes are both increasingly used for RWD-based pharmacovigilance, ADE rates substantially differ depending on data source. Conclusion: Pharmacovigilance based on RWD may lead to discrepant results depending on the data source analyzed. Further work is needed to confirm the validity of identified ADEs, to distinguish them from disease effects, and to understand tradeoffs in sensitivity and specificity between data sources.  © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

The results show that all compared countries (regardless of their historical context) deal with similar CHM challenges with a rather similar degree of success. A questionnaire distributed to hospitals clearly showed that there is still considerable room for improvement in terms of the use of specific CHM tools. A review focused on digital innovations based on the PRISMA statement showed that there are five main directions, namely, data collection and integration, telemedicine, artificial intelligence, electronic medical records, and M-Health. In the hospital environment, there are considerable reservations in applying change management principles, as well as the absence of a systemic approach. The main factors that must be monitored for a successful and sustainable CHM include a clearly defined and widely communicated vision, early engagement of all stakeholders, precisely set rules, adaptation to the local context and culture, provision of a technical base, and a step-by-step implementation with strong feedback. © 2021 by the authors.

415,Xiao D.; Song C.; Nakamura N.; Nakayama M.,Development of an application concerning fast healthcare interoperability resources based on standardized structured medical information exchange version 2 data,2021,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,11.0,10.1016/j.cmpb.2021.106232,"Background and objective: A mobile application for personal health records (PHR) would allow patients to access their clinical data easily. When PHR connects with multiple electronic health records (EHRs), doctors and patients can exchange large quantities of patient data from the EHR (e.g., medication list, diagnoses, allergies, and laboratory data). Furthermore, personal daily records can also be retrieved from PHR (e.g., blood pressure, pulse, dietary habits, and exercise). However, no standard interoperability between EHRs and PHR has been established. This study aims to convert clinical data in EHRs into the Health Level Seven (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) data format while developing a PHR application to present the FHIR data. Methods: In Japan, Standardized Structured Medical Information eXchange version 2 (SS-MIX2) is typically utilized as a health information exchange to preserve and elicit clinical data from EHRs. We converted clinical data in the SS-MIX2 storage at Tohoku University Hospital into the FHIR repository server using the R4 standard. Additionally, we used the Swift programming language to build a PHR application. Results: We converted patients’ basic information, disease names, diagnostic reports, prescriptions, and injection data from the SS-MIX2 to the FHIR server. Besides, we launched a PHR application that could retrieve data from the FHIR server to display patients’ clinical information. Conclusions: Our work demonstrated the conversion of SS-MIX2 data into the FHIR and presented them with our PHR application. This mechanism may be useful to accelerate the sharing of clinical information among doctors and patients. © 2021 The Authors",Electronic health record; Fast health interoperability resource; Health information exchange; Interoperability; Personal health record,"Delivery of Health Care; Electronic Health Records; Health Information Exchange; Health Level Seven; Health Records, Personal; Humans; Blood pressure; Data handling; Diagnosis; Digital storage; Electronic document exchange; Health care; Hospital data processing; Information dissemination; Records management; Clinical data; Clinical information; Electronic health; Fast health interoperability resource; Health information exchange; Health records; Healthcare Interoperability; Information exchanges; Medical information; Personal health record; Article; computer language; data base; diseases; Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources; health level 7; hospital information system; human; injection; Japan; medical informatics; medical information system; medical record; patient information; prescription; electronic health record; health care delivery; Interoperability",Elsevier Ireland Ltd,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access

Awareness of the potential value of such infrastructure has been heightened by COVID-19, as the lack of a real-time, interoperable data network impaired disease identification, mitigation, and eradication. The Sepsis on FHIR collaboration establishes a dynamic, federated, and interoperable system of sepsis data from 55 hospitals using 2 distinct inpatient electronic health record systems. Here we report on phase 1, a systematic review to identify clinical variables required to define sepsis and its subtypes to produce a concept mapping of elements onto Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). Relevant papers described consensus sepsis definitions, provided criteria for sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock, or detailed sepsis subtypes. Studies not written in English, published prior to 1970, or “grey” literature were prospectively excluded. We analyzed 55 manuscripts yielding 151 unique clinical variables. We then mapped variables to their corresponding US Core FHIR resources and specific code values. This work establishes the framework to develop a flexible infrastructure for sharing sepsis data, highlighting how FHIR could enable the extension of this approach to other important conditions relevant to public health. © 2022, The Author(s).",,COVID-19; Health care; Interoperability; albumin; epinephrine; hypertensive factor; nitrogen; noradrenalin; troponin; urea; vasoactive agent; Clinical care; Concept maps; Data infrastructure; Health policy; Health systems; Healthcare Interoperability; Potential values; Shared data; Spectra's; Systematic Review; acute kidney failure; age; albumin level; Article; blood pressure regulation; breathing rate; comorbidity; concept mapping; Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources; Glasgow coma scale; health care system; heart rate; human; hypotension; laboratory test; leukocyte count; lung infection; multiple organ failure; sepsis; septic shock; septicemia; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score; sex; systematic review; treatment duration; urea nitrogen blood level; Clinical research,Nature Research,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

Such governance frameworks require an accompanying technical framework to deploy models in a resource efficient, safe and high-quality manner. Here we present DEPLOYR, a technical framework for enabling real-time deployment and monitoring of researcher-created models into a widely used electronic medical record system. Materials and Methods: We discuss core functionality and design decisions, including mechanisms to trigger inference based on actions within electronic medical record software, modules that collect real-time data to make inferences, mechanisms that close-the-loop by displaying inferences back to end-users within their workflow, monitoring modules that track performance of deployed models over time, silent deployment capabilities, and mechanisms to prospectively evaluate a deployed model's impact. Results: We demonstrate the use of DEPLOYR by silently deploying and prospectively evaluating 12 machine learning models trained using electronic medical record data that predict laboratory diagnostic results, triggered by clinician button-clicks in Stanford Health Care's electronic medical record. Discussion: Our study highlights the need and feasibility for such silent deployment, because prospectively measured performance varies from retrospective estimates. When possible, we recommend using prospectively estimated performance measures during silent trials to make final go decisions for model deployment. Conclusion: Machine learning applications in healthcare are extensively researched, but successful translations to the bedside are rare. By describing DEPLOYR, we aim to inform machine learning deployment best practices and help bridge the model implementation gap.  © 2023 The Author(s).

Objective: The aim of this study was to (1) estimate the clerical workload of manual SOFA score calculation through a time-motion analysis and (2) describe a user-centered design process for an electronic medical record (EMR) integrated, automated SOFA score calculator with subsequent usability evaluation study. Methods: First, we performed a time-motion analysis by recording time-to-task-completion for the manual calculation of 35 baseline and 35 current SOFA scores by 14 internal medicine residents over a 2-month period. Next, we used an agile development process to create a user interface for a previously developed automated SOFA score calculator. The final user interface usability was evaluated by clinician end users with the Computer Systems Usability Questionnaire. Results: The overall mean (standard deviation, SD) time-to-complete manual SOFA score calculation time was 61.6 s (33). Among the 24% (12/50) usability survey respondents, our user-centered user interface design process resulted in >75% favorability of survey items in the domains of system usability, information quality, and interface quality. Conclusions: Early stakeholder engagement in our agile design process resulted in a user interface for an automated SOFA score calculator that reduced clinician workload and met clinicians' needs at the point of care. Emerging interoperable platforms may facilitate dissemination of similarly useful clinical score calculators and decision support algorithms as ""apps.""

To use this information effectively, clinicians may benefit from visual information displays that organize and help them make sense of information on past and current treatments, outcomes, and new treatment options. Unfortunately, few clinical decision support tools are designed to support clinical sensemaking. Objective ?The objective of this study was to describe a decision-centered design process, and resultant interactive patient information displays, to support key clinical decision requirements in chronic noncancer pain care. Methods ?To identify key clinical decision requirements, we conducted critical decision method interviews with 10 adult primary care clinicians. Next, to identify key information needs and decision support design seeds, we conducted a half-day multidisciplinary design workshop. Finally, we designed an interactive prototype to support the key clinical decision requirements and information needs uncovered during the previous research activities. Results ?The resulting Chronic Pain Treatment Tracker prototype summarizes the current treatment plan, past treatment history, potential future treatments, and treatment options to be cautious about. Clinicians can access additional details about each treatment, current or past, through modal views. Additional decision support for potential future treatments and treatments to be cautious about is also provided through modal views.

Setting: The deployment and testing of this app occurred in both the community and hospital settings in Pittsburgh, PA. Practice innovation: Medivate is an iOS smartphone application and cloud architecture for patients and providers to keep medication and vaccine lists accurate by providing a method and tool to easily exchange these data. Medications are added directly to the app from the electronic health record (EHR) or by the patient manually. Quick response (QR) code technology is used to trigger the secure transfer and sharing of medications on demand via HL-7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources–based data transfer. An iterative user-centered design process involving patients and student pharmacists practicing in community settings was used to develop and refine functionality. Practice description: Adults with an iPhone were approached for participation in the design and evaluation of Medivate. Its functionality and integration into clinical workflow at hospital discharge or vaccine administration in the community were determined. Evaluation: In the community setting, interviews of pharmacists were conducted. In the hospital, metrics of study participation and experience with app deployment were determined. Results: The app was deployed in the community for patients that received vaccinations. Interviews provided insight into barriers and logistics for successful engagement. The app was integrated into hospital workflow and demonstrated interoperability with the inpatient EHR. Thirteen patients were provided the app before discharge. Engagement with the app was evident through medication list shares, education access, and changes to medication lists. Patients noted strong agreement with usefulness of the app to learn more about the purposes and adverse effects of medications prescribed.

We describe activities that health systems are pursuing to better leverage health IT to improve performance. Methods: We conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with C-suite executives from 24 U.S. health systems in four states during 2017–2019 and analyzed the data using a qualitative thematic approach. Results: Health systems reported two broad categories of activities: laying the foundation to improve performance with IT and using IT to improve performance. Within these categories, health systems were engaged in similar activities but varied greatly in their progress. The most substantial effort was devoted to the first category, which enabled rather than directly improved performance, and included consolidating to a single electronic health record (EHR) platform and common data across the health system, standardizing data elements, and standardizing care processes before using the EHR to implement them. Only after accomplishing such foundational activities were health systems able to focus on using the technology to improve performance through activities such as using data and analytics to monitor and provide feedback, improving uptake of evidence-based medicine, addressing variation and overuse, improving system-wide prevention and population health management, and making care more convenient. Conclusions and implications: Leveraging IT to improve performance requires significant and sustained effort by health systems, in addition to significant investments in hardware and software. To accelerate change, better mechanisms for creating and disseminating best practices and providing advanced technical assistance are needed. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Electronic health records; Health care delivery systems; Health information technology; Health systems,American Recovery and Reinvestment Act; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Medical Informatics; Quality Improvement; United States; Article; artificial intelligence; biofeedback; computerized provider order entry; decision making; electronic health record; electronic prescribing; evidence based medicine; general practitioner; health care; health care delivery; health care organization; health care personnel; health care quality; hospitalization; human; machine learning; medical informatics; mobile application; patient care; population health management; priority journal; semi structured interview; software; telemedicine; total quality management; medical informatics; procedures; United States,Elsevier B.V.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access

A key research area focuses on the early detection of primary cancers and potential prediction of cancers of unknown primary in order to facilitate optimal treatment decisions. Objective: This study presents a methodology to harmonize phenotypic and genetic data features to classify primary cancer types and predict cancers of unknown primaries. Methods: We extracted genetic data elements from oncology genetic reports of 1011 patients with cancer and their corresponding phenotypical data from Mayo Clinic’s electronic health records. We modeled both genetic and electronic health record data with HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources. The semantic web Resource Description Framework was employed to generate the network-based data representation (ie, patient-phenotypic-genetic network). Based on the Resource Description Framework data graph, Node2vec graph-embedding algorithm was applied to generate features. Multiple machine learning and deep learning backbone models were compared for cancer prediction performance. Results: With 6 machine learning tasks designed in the experiment, we demonstrated the proposed method achieved favorable results in classifying primary cancer types (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] 96.56% for all 9 cancer predictions on average based on the cross-validation) and predicting unknown primaries (AUROC 80.77% for all 8 cancer predictions on average for real-patient validation). To demonstrate the interpretability, 17 phenotypic and genetic features that contributed the most to the prediction of each cancer were identified and validated based on a literature review. Conclusions: Accurate prediction of cancer types can be achieved with existing electronic health record data with satisfactory precision. The integration of genetic reports improves prediction, illustrating the translational values of incorporating genetic tests early at the diagnosis stage for patients with cancer. ©Nansu Zong, Victoria Ngo, Daniel J Stone, Andrew Wen, Yiqing Zhao, Yue Yu, Sijia Liu, Ming Huang, Chen Wang, Guoqian Jiang.",Electronic health records; Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources; FHIR; Genetic reports; Predicting primary cancers; RDF; Resource Description Framework,,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

While most of such prediction applications are developed to predict the risk of a particular acute event at one hospital, few efforts have been made in extending the developed solutions to other events or to different hospitals. We provide a scalable solution to extend the process of clinical risk prediction model development of multiple diseases and their deployment in different Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems. Materials and methods: We defined a generic process for clinical risk prediction model development. A calibration tool has been created to automate the model generation process. We applied the model calibration process at four hospitals, and generated risk prediction models for delirium, sepsis and acute kidney injury (AKI) respectively at each of these hospitals. Results: The delirium risk prediction models have on average an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.82 at admission and 0.95 at discharge on the test datasets of the four hospitals. The sepsis models have on average an AUROC of 0.88 and 0.95, and the AKI models have on average an AUROC of 0.85 and 0.92, at the day of admission and discharge respectively. Discussion: The scalability discussed in this paper is based on building common data representations (syntactic interoperability) between EHRs stored in different hospitals. Semantic interoperability, a more challenging requirement that different EHRs share the same meaning of data, e.g. a same lab coding system, is not mandated with our approach. Conclusions: Our study describes a method to develop and deploy clinical risk prediction models in a scalable way. We demonstrate its feasibility by developing risk prediction models for three diseases across four hospitals. © 2021",Acute kidney injury; Clinical decision support; Delirium; Electronic health records (EHR); Machine learning; Scalability; Sepsis,Electronic Health Records; Hospitalization; Hospitals; Humans; Machine Learning; ROC Curve; Forecasting; Health risks; Hospitals; Interoperability; Machine learning; Semantics; Clinical application; Electronic health record; Model calibration; Receiver operating characteristic curves; Risk prediction models; Scalable approach; Scalable solution; Semantic interoperability; acute kidney failure; adult; aged; algorithm; Article; calibration; data interoperability; decision support system; delirium; electronic health record; female; hospital care; human; machine learning; major clinical study; male; prediction; receiver operating characteristic; risk assessment; sepsis; electronic health record; hospital; hospitalization; machine learning; Predictive analytics,Academic Press Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access

The purpose of this study was to develop and internally validate a machine learning algorithm to identify key drivers of total charges after ambulatory arthroscopic rotator cuff repair and compare its performance with a state-of-the-art statistical learning model. Methods: A retrospective review of the New York State Ambulatory Surgery and Services Database was performed to identify patients who underwent elective outpatient rotator cuff repair (RCR) from 2015 to 2016. Initial models were constructed using patient characteristics (age, gender, insurance status, patient income, Elixhauser Comorbidity Index) as well as intraoperative variables (concomitant procedures and services, operative time). These were subsequently entered into 5 separate machine learning algorithms and a generalized additive model using natural splines. Global variable importance and partial dependence curves were constructed to identify the greatest contributors to cost. Results: A total of 33,976 patients undergoing ambulatory RCR were included. Median total charges after ambulatory RCR were $16,017 (interquartile range: $11,009-$22,510). The ensemble model outperformed the generalized additive model and demonstrated the best performance on internal validation (root mean squared error: $7112, 95% confidence interval: 7036-7188; logarithmic root mean squared error: 0.354, 95% confidence interval: 0.336-0.373, R2: 0.53), and identified major drivers of total charges after RCR as increasing operating room time, patient income level, number of anchors used, use of local infiltration anesthesia/peripheral nerve blocks, non-White race/ethnicity, and concurrent distal clavicle excision. The model was integrated into a web-based open-access application capable of providing individual predictions and explanations on a case-by-case basis. Conclusion: This study developed an ensemble supervised machine learning algorithm that outperformed a sophisticated statistical learning model in predicting total charges after ambulatory RCR. Important contributors to total charges included operating room time, duration of care, number of anchors used, type of anesthesia, concomitant distal clavicle excision, community characteristics, and patient demographic factors. Generation of a patient-specific payment schedule based on the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality risk of mortality highlighted the financial risk assumed by physicians in flat episodic reimbursement schedules given variable patient comorbidities and the importance of an accurate prediction algorithm to appropriately reward high-value care at low costs. © 2022 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees",arthroscopic rotator cuff repair; artificial intelligence; cost; Economic Analysis; Level IV; Machine learning; orthopedic; value-based care,Arthroplasty; Arthroscopy; Humans; Machine Learning; Rotator Cuff; Rotator Cuff Injuries; anesthetic agent; acromioplasty; adult; algorithm; ambulatory surgery; art; arthroscopic rotator cuff repair; Article; artificial intelligence; cohort analysis; comorbidity; confidence interval; Current Procedural Terminology; decision making; demographics; distal clavicle resection; elastic tissue; extreme gradient boosted machine; feature selection; female; general anesthesia; generalized additive model; health care cost; human; linear regression analysis; machine learning; major clinical study; male; mean squared error; nerve block; orthopedic surgery; outpatient care; Pacific Islander; random forest; regional anesthesia; reimbursement; retrospective study; root mean squared error; root mean squared logarithmic error; rotator cuff repair; statistical model; supervised machine learning; support vector machine; tenodesis; arthroplasty; arthroscopy; machine learning; procedures; rotator cuff; rotator cuff injury,Elsevier Inc.,,,,Article,Final,

This article explores the technical landscape for patient-centered CDS (PC CDS) and the gaps in making PC CDS more shareable, standards-based, and publicly available, with the goal of improving patient care and clinical outcomes. This landscape assessment used: (1) a technical expert panel; (2) a literature review; and (3) interviews with 18 CDS stakeholders. We identified 7 salient technical considerations that span 5 phases of PC CDS development. While progress has been made in the technical landscape, the field must advance standards for translating clinical guidelines into PC CDS, the standardization of CDS insertion points into the clinical workflow, and processes to capture, standardize, and integrate patient-generated health data.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

Centralized, web-based solutions offer a mechanism to share the cost of CDS development, maintenance, and implementation across practices. Data standards have emerged to facilitate interoperability and rapid integration of such third-party CDS. This case report describes the challenges to implementation and scalability of an integrated, web-based CDS intervention for EMergency department-initiated BuprenorphinE for opioid use Disorder which will soon be evaluated in a trial across 20 sites in five healthcare systems. Due to limitations of current standards, security concerns, and the need for resource-intensive local customization, barriers persist related to centralized CDS at this scale. These challenges demonstrate the need and importance for future standards to support two-way messaging (read and write) between electronic health records and web applications, thus allowing for more robust sharing across health systems and decreasing redundant, resource-intensive CDS development at individual sites. © The Author(s) 2019.

Widespread aging creates problems for social services and health care practices. In this light, research on connected health (CH) is becoming essential. CH refers to a variety of technological measures that allow health care to be provided remotely with the aim of increasing efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and satisfaction on the part of health care recipients. CH is reshaping health care's direction to be more proactive, more preventive, and more precisely targeted and, thus, more effective. CH has been demonstrated to have great value in managing and preventing chronic diseases, which create huge burdens on health care and social services. In short, CH provides promising solutions to diseases and social challenges associated with aging populations. However, there are many barriers that need to be overcome before CH can be successfully and widely implemented. Objective: The research question of this study is as follows: How can CH facilitate smart, remote, and targeted health care? The objective is to identify how health care can be managed in more comprehensive ways, such as by providing timely, flexible, accessible, and personalized services to preserve continuity and offer high-quality seamless health care. Methods: A qualitative approach was used based on 60 multistage, semistructured stakeholder interviews. Results: The results can be divided into two functions of CH: Ecosystem and platform. On the one hand, the interviews enabled the authors to develop a stakeholder classification and interaction diagram. These stakeholders interacted sequentially to provide technology-based content to end users. On the other hand, interviewees reflected on how CH serves as a platform to address remote monitoring and patient self-management. In the Discussion section, three innovation strategies are discussed to reflect the manner in which CH promotes smart, timely, and precise health care. Conclusions: This study indicates that it is essential to continually revise CH business models, given the ongoing and rapid changes in technology across groups of CH stakeholders. We also found that global trends toward smart, timely, and precise health care shape what individuals expect from products and services, providing firms with unique opportunities for growth. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Therapeutic clinical trials are necessary to test new PM drugs to advance precision medicine, however, the abundance of patient sequencing data coupled with complex clinical trial eligibility has made it challenging to match patients to PM trials. To facilitate enrollment onto PM trials, we developed MatchMiner, an open-source platform to computationally match genomically profiled cancer patients to PM trials. Here, we describe MatchMiner’s capabilities, outline its deployment at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), and characterize its impact on PM trial enrollment. MatchMiner’s primary goals are to facilitate PM trial options for all patients and accelerate trial enrollment onto PM trials. MatchMiner can help clinicians find trial options for an individual patient or provide trial teams with candidate patients matching their trial’s eligibility criteria. From March 2016 through March 2021, we curated 354 PM trials containing a broad range of genomic and clinical eligibility criteria and MatchMiner facilitated 166 trial consents (MatchMiner consents, MMC) for 159 patients. To quantify MatchMiner’s impact on trial consent, we measured time from genomic sequencing report date to trial consent date for the 166 MMC compared to trial consents not facilitated by MatchMiner (non-MMC). We found MMC consented to trials 55 days (22%) earlier than non-MMC. MatchMiner has enabled our clinicians to match patients to PM trials and accelerated the trial enrollment process. © 2022, The Author(s).",,anaplastic lymphoma kinase; B Raf kinase; brain derived neurotrophic factor receptor; BRCA1 protein; BRCA2 protein; epidermal growth factor receptor; isocitrate dehydrogenase 1; isocitrate dehydrogenase 2; K ras protein; partner and localizer of BRCA2; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; breast cancer; cancer patient; cancer therapy; child; clinical trial registry; clinician; cohort analysis; controlled study; copy number alteration; eligibility criteria; female; gene mutation; genetic parameters; genetic profile; genetic variation; high throughput sequencing; human; informed consent; major clinical study; male; markup language; medical information; non small cell lung cancer; personalized medicine; school child; solid malignant neoplasm; tumor mutational burden; very elderly,Nature Research,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

Currently, there is a lack of consensus about digital health research priorities in palliative care and a lack of theories about how these technologies might improve care outcomes. Therefore, it is important for health care leaders to identify innovations to ensure that an increasingly frail population has appropriate access to palliative care services. Consequently, it is important to articulate research priorities as the first step in determining how finite resources should be allocated to a field saturated with rapidly developing innovation. Objective: The aim of this study is to identify research priority areas for digital health in palliative care. Methods: We selected digital health trends, most relevant to palliative care, from a list of emerging trends reported by a leading institute of quantitative futurists. We conducted 2 rounds of the Delphi questionnaire, followed by a consensus meeting and public engagement workshop to establish a final consensus on research priorities for digital technology in palliative care. We used the views of public representatives to gain their perspectives on the agreed priorities. Results: A total of 103 experts (representing 11 countries) participated in the first Delphi round. Of the 103 experts, 55 (53.3%) participated in the second round. The final consensus meetings were attended by 10.7% (11/103) of the experts. We identified 16 priority areas, which involved many applications of technologies, including care for patients and caregivers, self-management and reporting of diseases, education and training, communication, care coordination, and research methodology. We summarized the priority areas into eight topics: big data, mobile devices, telehealth and telemedicine, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, smart home, biotechnology, and digital legacy. Conclusions: The priorities identified in this study represent a wide range of important emerging areas in the fields of digital health, personalized medicine, and data science. Human-centered design and robust governance systems should be considered in future research. It is important that the risks of using these technologies in palliative care are properly addressed to ensure that these tools are used meaningfully, wisely, and safely and do not cause unintentional harm. © 2022 JMIR Publications Inc..

The existing literature shows different methods to overcome this problem. Fast healthcare interoperable resources (FHIR) as a structural standard may explain other information models, (e.g., personal, physiological, and behavioral data from heterogeneous sources, such as activity sensors, questionnaires, and interviews) with semantic vocabularies, (e.g., Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine—Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT)) to connect personal health data to an electronic health record (EHR). We design and develop an intuitive health coaching (eCoach) smartphone application to prove the concept. We combine HL7 FHIR and SNOMED-CT vocabularies to exchange personal health data in JavaScript object notion (JSON). This study explores and analyzes our attempt to design and implement a structurally and logically compatible tethered personal health record (PHR) that allows bidirectional communication with an EHR. Our eCoach prototype implements most PHR-S FM functions as an interoperability quality standard. Its end-to-end (E2E) data are protected with a TSD (Services for Sensitive Data) security mechanism. We achieve 0% data loss and 0% unreliable performances during data transfer between PHR and EHR.

Within this context, patient stratification across health institutions due to omic profiling presents a complex scenario to carry out multi-center clinical trials. Methods This paper presents a standards-based approach to ensure semantic integration required to facilitate the analysis of clinico-genomic clinical trials. To ensure interoperability across different institutions, we have developed a Semantic Interoperability Layer (SIL) to facilitate homogeneous access to clinical and genetic information, based on different well-established biomedical standards and following International Health (IHE) recommendations. Results The SIL has shown suitability for integrating biomedical knowledge and technologies to match the latest clinical advances in healthcare and the use of genomic information. This genomic data integration in the SIL has been tested with a diagnostic classifier tool that takes advantage of harmonized multi-center clinico-genomic data for training statistical predictive models. Conclusions The SIL has been adopted in national and international research initiatives, such as the EURECA-EU research project and the CIMED collaborative Spanish project, where the proposed solution has been applied and evaluated by clinical experts focused on clinico-genomic studies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Biomedical terminologies; Clinical research informatics; Data integration; Diagnostic classifier; Gene expressions; Semantic interoperability,Breast Neoplasms; Female; Gene Expression; Humans; Semantics; Gene expression; Genes; Interoperability; Semantics; Clinical information; Clinical research informatics; Genetic information; International healths; International researches; Multi-center clinical trials; Semantic integration; Semantic interoperability; Article; breast cancer; cancer research; clinical research; clinical trial (topic); consensus; electronic health record; follow up; gene expression; gene ontology; human; information processing; information system; laboratory test; Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes; priority journal; recurrence free survival; Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine; treatment outcome; breast tumor; female; genetics; semantics; Data integration,Elsevier Ltd,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access

In support of HIE, the Health Level Seven (HL7) XML standard was developed to manage, exchange, integrate, and retrieve electronic health information. In 2011, the Fast Healthcare Interoperable Resources (FHIR) standard, based on HL7, was proposed to facilitate the development of mobile Health (mHealth) apps with HIT data sharing via a common modeling format. FHIR utilizes RESTful APIs enabled with a FHIR server for information usage and exchange in the cloud. FHIR has a security specification, but does not define actual security mechanisms for secure data exchange via service invocations. If services are the primary means of access, there must be a way to control who can invoke which service at which time. This paper proposes the use of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Mandatory Access Control (MAC) to define permissions based on role and/or the sensitivity level of services. This is accomplished by evolving RBAC and MAC to support permissions on services (as opposed to the usual object view) at a model level applied to a setting where a mobile application is using RESTful APIs. The resulting service-based model is incorporated into the FHIR standard to control the access of who can invoke which services of FHIR RESTful APIs that manage the sensitive healthcare data; work is demonstrated via an mHealth application that interacts with the OpenEMR HIT system via the HAPI FHIR server. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications",Access control; FHIR; Healthcare systems; MAC; Mobile applications; RBAC,,Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

The rule is meant to create an ecosystem of reusable, substitutable apps that can be built once but run at any hospital system “without special effort.” Yet, despite numerous provisions around information blocking in the final rule, there is concern that the business practices that govern EHR vendors and health care organizations in the United States could still stifle innovation. We describe potential app ecosystems that may form. We caution that misaligned incentives may result in anticompetitive behavior and purposefully limited functionality. Closed proprietary ecosystems may result, limiting the value derived from interoperability. The 21st Century Cures Act and final rule are an exciting step in the direction of improved interoperability.

Without prioritization, physicians must mentally identify and collate relevant data, an activity that can lead to cognitive overload. To mitigate cognitive overload, a Learning EMR (LEMR) system prioritizes the display of relevant medical record data. Relevant data are those that are pertinent to a context-defined as the combination of the user, clinical task, and patient case. To determine which data are relevant in a specific context, a LEMR system uses supervised machine learning models of physician information-seeking behavior. Since obtaining information-seeking behavior data via manual annotation is slow and expensive, automatic methods for capturing such data are needed. Objective: The goal of the research was to propose and evaluate eye tracking as a high-throughput method to automatically acquire physician information-seeking behavior useful for training models for a LEMR system. Methods: Critical care medicine physicians reviewed intensive care unit patient cases in an EMR interface developed for the study. Participants manually identified patient data that were relevant in the context of a clinical task: preparing a patient summary to present at morning rounds. We used eye tracking to capture each physician's gaze dwell time on each data item (eg, blood glucose measurements). Manual annotations and gaze dwell times were used to define target variables for developing supervised machine learning models of physician information-seeking behavior. We compared the performance of manual selection and gaze-derived models on an independent set of patient cases. Results: A total of 68 pairs of manual selection and gaze-derived machine learning models were developed from training data and evaluated on an independent evaluation data set. A paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed similar performance of manual selection and gaze-derived models on area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (P=.40). Conclusions: We used eye tracking to automatically capture physician information-seeking behavior and used it to train models for a LEMR system. The models that were trained using eye tracking performed like models that were trained using manual annotations. These results support further development of eye tracking as a high-throughput method for training clinical decision support systems that prioritize the display of relevant medical record data. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Focusing on endometriosis, an enigmatic chronic condition, we conducted interviews with specialists and focus groups with patients to elicit their work in care specifically pertaining to dealing with an enigmatic disease, both independently and in partnership, and how technology could support these efforts. We found that the work to care for the illness, including reflecting on the illness experience and planning for care, is significantly compounded by the complex nature of the disease: enigmatic condition means uncertainty and frustration in care and management; the multi-factorial and systemic features of endometriosis without any guidance to interpret them overwhelm patients and providers; the different temporal resolutions of this chronic condition confuse both patients and providers; and patients and providers negotiate medical knowledge and expertise in an attempt to align their perspectives. We note how this added complexity demands that patients and providers work together to find common ground and align perspectives, and propose three design opportunities (considerations to construct a holistic picture of the patient, design features to reflect and make sense of the illness, and opportunities and mechanisms to correct misalignments and plan for care) and implications to support patients and providers in their care work. Specifically, the enigmatic nature of endometriosis necessitates complementary approaches from human-centered computing and artificial intelligence, and thus opens a number of future research avenues.  © 2021 Owner/Author.",enigmatic disease; illness work; patient-provider partnership,Chronic conditions; Complex nature; Condition; Enigmatic disease; Focus groups; Illness work; Medical knowledge; Patient-provider partnership; Temporal resolution; Uncertainty; Diseases,Association for Computing Machinery,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access

This can lead to divergence in electronic implementations, reducing the usefulness of collected data outside of that implementation setting. This work set out to evolve guidelines-based data dictionaries by mapping to HL7 Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and semantic terminology, thus progressing toward machine-readable guidelines that define the minimum data set required to support family planning and sexually transmitted infections. Material and methods: The data dictionaries were first structured to facilitate mapping to FHIR and semantic terminologies, including ICD-10, SNOMED-CT, LOINC, and RxNorm. FHIR resources and codes were assigned to data dictionary terms. The data dictionary and mappings were used as inputs for a newly developed tool to generate FHIR implementation guides. Results: Implementation guides for core data requirements for family planning and sexually transmitted infections were created. These implementation guides display data dictionary content as FHIR resources and semantic terminology codes. Challenges included the use of a two-dimensional spreadsheet to facilitate mapping, the need to create FHIR profiles and resource extensions, and applying FHIR to a data dictionary that was created with a user interface in mind. Conclusions: Authoring FHIR implementation guides is a complex and evolving practice, and there are limited examples for this groundbreaking work. Moving toward machine-readable guidelines by mapping to FHIR and semantic terminologies requires a thorough understanding of the context and use of terminology, an applied information model, and other strategies for optimizing the creation and long-term management of implementation guides. Next steps for this work include validation and, eventually, real-world application.

Numerous clinical decision support tools exist in today's electronic health records (EHRs) such as medication dosing support, order facilitators (eg, procedure specific order sets), and point of care alerts. However, less has been done to integrate artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled risk predictors into EHRs despite wide availability of validated risk prediction tools. An interoperability standard known as SMART on FHIR (substitutable medical applications and reusable technologies on fast health interoperability resources) offers a promising path forward, enabling digital innovations to be seamlessly integrated with the EHR with regard to the user interface and patient data. For the next step in progress towards the goal of learning healthcare and informatics-enabled spine surgery, we propose the application of SMART on FHIR to integrate existing and new risk predictions tools in spine surgery through an EHR add-on-application. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Artificial intelligence; Clinical decision support; Diagnosis; Electronic medical records; Integration; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Prediction; SMART on FHIR; Spine,"Artificial Intelligence; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Models, Statistical; Point-of-Care Systems; Precision Medicine; Prognosis; Software; Article; artificial intelligence; clinical decision making; clinical decision support system; clinician; electronic health record; human; hyperbilirubinemia; medical informatics; natural language processing; nomogram; patient coding; patient information; patient satisfaction; personalized medicine; phototherapy; point of care testing; professional burnout; spine surgery; treatment outcome; point of care system; prognosis; software; statistical model",Elsevier Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access

Smart insulin pens (SIPs) have the potential to reshape a connected diabetes care ecosystem for patients, providers, and health systems. Existing SIPs are enhanced with real-time wireless connectivity, digital dose capture, and integration with personalized dosing decision support. Automatic dose capture can promote effective retrospective review of insulin dose data, particularly when paired with glucose data. Patients, providers, and diabetes care teams will be able to make increasingly data-driven decisions and recommendations, in real time, during scheduled visits, and in a more continuous, asynchronous care model. As SIPs continue to progress along the path of digital transformation, we can expect additional benefits: iteratively improving software, machine learning, and advanced decision support. Both these technological advances, and future care delivery models with asynchronous interactions, will depend on easy, open, and continuous data exchange between the growing number of diabetes devices. SIPs have a key role in modernizing diabetes care for a large population of people living with diabetes. © 2021 Diabetes Technology Society.",diabetes mellitus; digital health; insulin delivery; telehealth,Diabetes Mellitus; Ecosystem; Humans; Insulin; Insulin Infusion Systems; Machine Learning; carbohydrate; glucose; insulin; insulin; Article; blood glucose monitoring; clinical practice; data integration; decision support system; diabetes mellitus; digital dose capture; digital technology; digital transformation; dose; drug safety; ecosystem; electronic health record; Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources; health care; health insurance; human; injection; insulin infusion; insulin treatment; machine learning; medication compliance; population health; software; telehealth; United States; wireless communication; diabetes mellitus,SAGE Publications Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access

Patient records need to accommodate data of unprecedented size and complexity as well as keep track of their production process. In this work we present a solution for integrating genomic data into electronic health records via openEHR archetypes. Methods: We use the popular Variant Call Format as the base format to represent genetic test results within openEHR. We evaluate existing openEHR archetypes to determine what can be extended or specialized and what needs to be developed ex novo. Results: Eleven new archetypes have been developed, while an existing one has been specialized to represent genomic data. We show their applicability to rare genetic diseases and compare our approach to HL7 FHIR. Conclusion: The proposed model allows to represent genetic test results in health records in a structured format. It supports different levels of abstraction, allowing both automated processing and clinical decision support. It is extensible via external references, allowing to keep track of data provenance and adapt to future domain changes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Electronic health record; Genomics; OpenEHR; Structured data; Variant calling,"Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Electronic Health Records; Genetic Testing; Genetic Variation; Genome, Human; Genomics; Humans; Medical Informatics Applications; Models, Theoretical; Rare Diseases; Systems Integration; Decision support systems; Genes; Records management; base; Electronic health record; Genomics; OpenEHR; Structured data; Variant calling; Article; automation; clinical practice; decision support system; electronic health record; genetic disorder; genomics; high throughput sequencing; information science; personalized medicine; priority journal; rare disease; clinical decision support system; electronic health record; genetic screening; genetic variation; genetics; genomics; human; human genome; medical informatics; organization and management; procedures; rare disease; statistics and numerical data; system analysis; theoretical model; Health",Elsevier Ireland Ltd,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access

Communication of genetic laboratory results to patients and providers is hampered by the complex technical nature of the laboratory reports. This can lead to confusion and misinterpretation of the results resulting in inappropriate care. Patients usually do not receive a copy of the report leading to further opportunities for miscommunication. To address these problems, interpretive reports were created using input from the intended end users, patients and providers. This paper describes the technical development and deployment of the first patient-facing genomic test report (PGR) within an electronic health record (EHR) ecosystem using a locally developed standards-based web-application interface. Methods: A patient-facing genomic test report with a companion provider report was configured for implementation within the EHR using a locally developed software platform, COMPASS™. COMPASS™ is designed to manage secure data exchange, as well as patient and provider access to patient reported data capture and clinical display tools. COMPASS™ is built using a Software as a Service (SaaS) approach which exposes an API that apps can interact with. Results: An authoring tool was developed that allowed creation of patient-specific PGRs and the accompanying provider reports. These were converted to a format that allowed them to be presented in the patient portal and EHR respectively using the existing COMPASS™ interface thus allowing patients, caregivers and providers access to individual reports designed for the intended end user. Conclusions: The PGR as developed was shown to enhance patient and provider communication around genomic results. It is built on current standards but is designed to support integration with other tools and be compatible with emerging opportunities such as SMART on FHIR. This approach could be used to support genomic return of results as the tool is scalable and generalizable. © 2018 The Author(s).",Communication; Electronic health records; Genomics; Medical informatics applications; Patient access to records; Patient-centered care,Disclosure; Electronic Health Records; Genetic Testing; Humans; Medical Informatics Applications; Patient Access to Records; Professional-Patient Relations; adult; article; caregiver; case report; clinical article; ecosystem; electronic health record; female; genomics; human; male; medical informatics; patient care; patient right; software; genetic screening; interpersonal communication; professional-patient relationship,BioMed Central Ltd,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

For instance, Electronic Health Records are usually administered by governments. Electronic Medical Records are typically controlled by health care providers, whereas Personal Health Records are managed directly by patients. Recently, Blockchain-based health record systems largely regulated by technology have emerged as another type of repository. Repositories for storing health data differ from one another based on cost, level of security and quality of performance. Not only has the type of repositories increased in recent years, but the quantum of health data to be stored has increased. For instance, the advent of wearable sensors that capture physiological signs has resulted in an exponential growth in digital health data. The increase in the types of repository and amount of data has driven a need for intelligent processes to select appropriate repositories as data is collected. However, the storage allocation decision is complex and nuanced. The challenges are exacerbated when health data are continuously streamed, as is the case with wearable sensors. Although patients are not always solely responsible for determining which repository should be used, they typically have some input into this decision. Patients can be expected to have idiosyncratic preferences regarding storage decisions depending on their unique contexts. In this paper, we propose a predictive model for the storage of health data that can meet patient needs and make storage decisions rapidly, in real-time, even with data streaming from wearable sensors. The model is built with a machine learning classifier that learns the mapping between characteristics of health data and features of storage repositories from a training set generated synthetically from correlations evident from small samples of experts. Results from the evaluation demonstrate the viability of the machine learning technique used. © The Author(s) 2020.",Big Health data; Blockchain; classifier; deep learning; digital health record storage; electronic health record; machine learning; quality of performance; security and privacy; stream data,"Blockchain; Electronic Health Records; Health Records, Personal; Humans; Machine Learning; Technology; electronic health record; human; machine learning; medical record; technology",SAGE Publications Ltd,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

There is an urgent need to increase research on this area, and the secondary use of healthcare data has the potential to provide valuable insights on survivors' health trajectories.

In this study we present CASIDE, an interoperable data model for cancer survivorship information that aims to accelerate the secondary use of healthcare data and data sharing across institutions. It is designed to provide a holistic view of the cancer survivor, taking into account not just the clinical data but also the patient's own perspective, and is built upon the emerging Health Level Seven (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. Advantages of adopting FHIR and challenges in information modelling using this standard are discussed.

We can resolve such data and process level heterogeneities by following consistent healthcare standards like Clinical Document Architecture (CDA), OpenEHR, and HL7 FHIR. However, these standards also differ at the structural and implementation level, making interoperability more complex. Hence, there is a need to investigate mechanisms that can resolve data level heterogeneity to achieve semantic data interoperability between heterogeneous systems. As a solution to this, we offer an architecture that utilizes a resource server based on GraphQL and HL7 FHIR that establishes communication between two heterogeneous EHRs. This paper describes how the proposed architecture is implemented to achieve interoperability between two heterogeneous EHRs, HL7 FHIR and OpenMRS.

A preoperative clinical prediction model can aid surgeons and patients in the shared decision-making process, and optimize care for elderly femoral neck fracture patients. This study aimed to develop and internally validate a clinical prediction model using machine learning (ML) algorithms for 90 day and 2 year mortality in femoral neck fracture patients aged 65 years or above. Methods: A retrospective cohort study at two trauma level I centers and three (non-level I) community hospitals was conducted to identify patients undergoing surgical fixation for a femoral neck fracture. Five different ML algorithms were developed and internally validated and assessed by discrimination, calibration, Brier score and decision curve analysis. Results: In total, 2478 patients were included with 90 day and 2 year mortality rates of 9.1% (n = 225) and 23.5% (n = 582) respectively. The models included patient characteristics, comorbidities and laboratory values. The stochastic gradient boosting algorithm had the best performance for 90 day mortality prediction, with good discrimination (c-statistic = 0.74), calibration (intercept = − 0.05, slope = 1.11) and Brier score (0.078). The elastic-net penalized logistic regression algorithm had the best performance for 2 year mortality prediction, with good discrimination (c-statistic = 0.70), calibration (intercept = − 0.03, slope = 0.89) and Brier score (0.16). The models were incorporated into a freely available web-based application, including individual patient explanations for interpretation of the model to understand the reasoning how the model made a certain prediction: https://sorg-apps.shinyapps.io/hipfracturemortality/ Conclusions: The clinical prediction models show promise in estimating mortality prediction in elderly femoral neck fracture patients.

The cloud-based Electronic Health Records (EHR) sharing scheme has provided many benefits in recent years, but the centralization of the cloud raises challenges to privacy protection and data security. Blockchain technology is viewed as a possible solution to these challenges because of its unique properties of unforgeability, anonymity, and verifiability. Therefore, a blockchain based secure data outsourcing scheme is proposed in this paper. In the proposed scheme, each activity on outsourcing EHRs is recorded as a transaction on the public blockchain, authenticity is ensured by registration, and secure data access is ensured by keyword search. Initially, the EHR is encrypted by the proposed Enhanced Map Chaotic Encryption (EMCE) algorithm to ensure confidentiality. Then, data de-duplication is performed by the proposed Tri-Level Chunk Hashing (TL-CH) technique to eliminated duplicate records and reduce the storage space. Finally, the integrity of outsourced EHRs is validated by the Third-Party Auditor (TPA). The performance and security analysis show that the proposed scheme can provide solid security against various attacks, and the storage space is reduced. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Auditing; Blockchain; De-duplication; EHR; Encryption; Integrity; Outsourcing,Blockchain; Cloud storage; Cryptography; Search engines; Auditing; Block-chain; Data de duplications; Data outsourcing; Deduplication; Electronic health; Electronic health record; Health records; Integrity; Secure data; Outsourcing,Elsevier B.V.,,,,Article,Final,

Materials and Methods: We employed a single-subject design study to evaluate PresRx OCR for three outcomes: (1) accuracy of auto-populated medication dosing instructions, (2) acceptability of the user interface, and (3) patients' adherence to chronic medications. Results: Eight patients beta-tested PresRx OCR. Five patients used the software for ≥6 months, and four completed exit interviews (n = 4 completers). At baseline, patients used 3.4 chronic prescription medications and exhibited moderate-to-high adherence rates. Accuracy of auto-populated information by OCR was 95% for drug name, 98% for dose, and 96% for frequency. Study completers rated PresRx OCR 74 on the System Usability Scale, where scores ≥70 indicate an acceptable user interface (scale 0-100). Adherence rates measured by PresRx OCR were high during the first month of app use (93%), but waned midway through the 6-month testing period (78%). Compared with pharmacy fill rates, PresRx OCR underestimated adherence among completers by 3%, while it overestimated adherence among noncompleters by 8%. Discussion: Results suggest smartphone applications supporting medication management are feasible and accurately assess adherence compared with objective measures. Future efforts to improve medication-taking behavior using m-health tools should target specific patient populations and leverage common application programming interfaces to promote generalizability. Conclusions: Our medication management application PresRx OCR is innovative, acceptable for patient use, and accurately tracks medication adherence. © 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",adherence; health information technology; m-health; Medication management; smartphone,Adult; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Medication Adherence; Middle Aged; Mobile Applications; Smartphone; Software Design; User-Computer Interface; Application programming interfaces (API); Character recognition; Drug dosage; Health; Interfaces (materials); mHealth; Optical character recognition; Smartphones; adherence; Health information technologies; Medication adherence; Medication management; Mobile Health (M-Health); Optical character recognition (OCR); Patient population; Smart-phone applications; adult; computer interface; feasibility study; female; human; male; medication compliance; middle aged; mobile application; smartphone; software design; User interfaces,Mary Ann Liebert Inc.,,,,Article,Final,

Using qualitative and quantitative data from three large-scale health care delivery innovations-accountable care organizations, advanced primary care practice, and EvidenceNOW-we assessed where data-driven innovation is occurring and where challenges lie. We found that implementation of some technological components of innovation (for example, electronic health records) has occurred among health care organizations, but core functions needed to use data to drive innovation are lacking. Deficits include the inability to extract and aggregate data from the records; gaps in sharing data; and challenges in adopting advanced data functions, particularly those related to timely reporting of performance data. The unexpectedly high costs and burden incurred during implementation of the innovations have limited organizations' ability to address these and other deficits. Solutions that could help speed progress in data-driven innovation include facilitating peer-to-peer technical assistance, providing tailored feedback reports to providers from data aggregators, and using practice facilitators skilled in using data technology for quality improvement to help practices transform.

Materials and Methods: We applied an HCD process to develop a Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) application that displays a patient's asthma history to clinicians in a pediatric emergency department. We performed a preimplementation comparative system evaluation to measure time on task, number of screens, information retrieval accuracy, cognitive load, user satisfaction, and perceived utility and usefulness. Application usage and system functionality were assessed using application logs and a postimplementation survey of end users. Results: Usability testing of the Asthma Timeline Application demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in time on task (P <. 001), number of screens (P <. 001), and cognitive load (P <. 001) for clinicians when compared to base EHR functionality. Postimplementation evaluation demonstrated reliable functionality and high user satisfaction. Discussion: Following HCD processes to develop an application in the context of clinical operations/quality improvement is feasible. Our work also highlights the potential benefits and challenges associated with using internationally recognized data exchange standards as currently implemented. Conclusion: Compared to standard EHR functionality, our visualization increased clinician efficiency when reviewing the charts of pediatric asthma patients. Application development efforts in an operational context should leverage existing health information exchange standards, such as FHIR, and evidence-based mixed methods approaches.  © 2021 The Author(s).

Most models are developed and evaluated with retrospective data, very few are evaluated in a clinical workflow, and even fewer report performances in different hospitals. In this study, we provide detailed evaluations of clinical risk prediction models in live clinical workflows for three different use cases in three different hospitals. Objective: The main objective of this study was to evaluate clinical risk prediction models in live clinical workflows and compare their performance in these setting with their performance when using retrospective data. We also aimed at generalizing the results by applying our investigation to three different use cases in three different hospitals. Methods: We trained clinical risk prediction models for three use cases (ie, delirium, sepsis, and acute kidney injury) in three different hospitals with retrospective data. We used machine learning and, specifically, deep learning to train models that were based on the Transformer model. The models were trained using a calibration tool that is common for all hospitals and use cases. The models had a common design but were calibrated using each hospital's specific data. The models were deployed in these three hospitals and used in daily clinical practice. The predictions made by these models were logged and correlated with the diagnosis at discharge. We compared their performance with evaluations on retrospective data and conducted cross-hospital evaluations. Results: The performance of the prediction models with data from live clinical workflows was similar to the performance with retrospective data. The average value of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) decreased slightly by 0.6 percentage points (from 94.8% to 94.2% at discharge). The cross-hospital evaluations exhibited severely reduced performance: the average AUROC decreased by 8 percentage points (from 94.2% to 86.3% at discharge), which indicates the importance of model calibration with data from the deployment hospital. Conclusions: Calibrating the prediction model with data from different deployment hospitals led to good performance in live settings. The performance degradation in the cross-hospital evaluation identified limitations in developing a generic model for different hospitals. Designing a generic process for model development to generate specialized prediction models for each hospital guarantees model performance in different hospitals. © 2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

However, patients' health information is stored in several health information systems and interoperability problems often hamper accessibility. In Sweden a national health information exchange (HIE) platform has been developed that enables information exchange between different health information systems. The aim of this study is to explore the opportunities and limitations of accessing and interacting with important health information through the Swedish national HIE platform. Methods: A single case study approach was used for this study as an in-depth understanding of the subject was needed. A fictive patient case with a pseudo-name was created based on an interview with a stroke coordinator in Stockholm County. Information access through the national health information exchange platform and available service contracts and application programming interfaces were studied using different scenarios. Results: Based on the scenarios created in this study, patients would be able to access some health related information from their electronic health records using the national health information exchange platform. However, there is necessary information which is not retrievable as it is either stored in electronic health records and eHealth services which are not connected to the national health information exchange platform or there is no service contract developed for these types of information. In addition, patients are not able to share information with healthcare professionals. Conclusion: The national Swedish HIE platform provides the building blocks needed to allow patients online access to their health information in a fragmented and distributed health system. However, more complex interaction scenarios allowing patients to communicate with their health care providers or to update their health related information are not yet supported. Therefore it is of great importance to involve patients throughout the design and evaluation of eHealth services on both national and local levels to ensure that their needs for interoperability and information exchange are met. © 2019 The Author(s).",eHealth services; Health information exchange; Interoperability,Access to Information; Electronic Health Records; Health Information Exchange; Health Information Systems; Humans; Information Dissemination; Patient Discharge; Stroke; Sweden; Telemedicine; access to information; cerebrovascular accident; electronic health record; hospital discharge; human; information dissemination; medical information system; Sweden; telemedicine,BioMed Central Ltd,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access
463,Ndlovu K.; Scott R.E.; Mars M.,Interoperability opportunities and challenges in linking mhealth applications and eRecord systems: Botswana as an exemplar,2021,BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making,17.0,10.1186/s12911-021-01606-7,"Background: Significant investments have been made towards the implementation of mHealth applications and eRecord systems globally. However, fragmentation of these technologies remains a big challenge, often unresolved in developing countries. In particular, evidence shows little consideration for linking mHealth applications and eRecord systems. Botswana is a typical developing country in sub-Saharan Africa that has explored mHealth applications, but the solutions are not interoperable with existing eRecord systems. This paper describes Botswana’s eRecord systems interoperability landscape and provides guidance for linking mHealth applications to eRecord systems, both for Botswana and for developing countries using Botswana as an exemplar. Methods: A survey and interviews of health ICT workers and a review of the Botswana National eHealth Strategy were completed. Perceived interoperability benefits, opportunities and challenges were charted and analysed, and future guidance derived. Results: Survey and interview responses showed the need for interoperable mHealth applications and eRecord systems within the health sector of Botswana and within the context of the National eHealth Strategy. However, the current Strategy does not address linking mHealth applications to eRecord systems. Across Botswana’s health sectors, global interoperability standards and Application Programming Interfaces are widely used, with some level of interoperability within, but not between, public and private facilities. Further, a mix of open source and commercial eRecord systems utilising relational database systems and similar data formats are supported. Challenges for linking mHealth applications and eRecord systems in Botswana were identified and categorised into themes which led to development of guidance to enhance the National eHealth Strategy. Conclusion: Interoperability between mHealth applications and eRecord systems is needed and is feasible. Opportunities and challenges for linking mHealth applications to eRecord systems were identified, and future guidance stemming from this insight presented. Findings will aid Botswana, and other developing countries, in resolving the pervasive disconnect between mHealth applications and eRecord systems. © 2021, The Author(s).",Botswana; Challenges; eHealth; eRecord systems; Interoperability; mHealth applications; Opportunities,Africa South of the Sahara; Botswana; Humans; Telemedicine; article; Botswana; building; data interoperability; developing country; human; interview; telehealth; worker; Africa south of the Sahara; Botswana; telemedicine,BioMed Central Ltd,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

We set out to provide a framework for prediction across healthcare settings. As a case study, we examined an ED disposition prediction model across three geographically and demographically diverse sites. We conducted a 1-year retrospective study, including all visits in which the outcome was either discharge-to-home or hospitalization. Four modeling approaches were compared: a ready-made model trained at one site and validated at other sites, a centralized uniform model incorporating data from all sites, multiple site-specific models, and a hybrid approach of a ready-made model re-calibrated using site-specific data. Predictions were performed using XGBoost. The study included 288,962 visits with an overall admission rate of 16.8% (7.9–26.9%). Some risk factors for admission were prominent across all sites (e.g., high-acuity triage emergency severity index score, high prior admissions rate), while others were prominent at only some sites (multiple lab tests ordered at the pediatric sites, early use of ECG at the adult site). The XGBoost model achieved its best performance using the uniform and site-specific approaches (AUC = 0.9–0.93), followed by the calibrated-model approach (AUC = 0.87–0.92), and the ready-made approach (AUC = 0.62–0.85). Our results show that site-specific customization is a key driver of predictive model performance. © 2021, The Author(s).",,Electrocardiograms; Health care; Hospitals; Admission rate; Case-studies; Clinical sites; Comparative data; Emergency departments; Modeling approach; Performance; Prediction modelling; Predictive models; Site-specific; adult; article; child; controlled study; electrocardiogram; emergency health service; emergency ward; female; hospitalization; human; laboratory test; male; prediction; retrospective study; risk factor; Forecasting,Nature Research,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

To meet this need, several large new data consortia have been developed that require frequent updating and sharing of electronic health record (EHR) data in different common data models (CDMs) to create multi-institutional databases for research. Traditionally, each CDM has had a custom pipeline for extract, transform, and load operations for production and incremental updates of data feeds to the networks from raw EHR data. However, the demands of COVID-19 research for timely data are far higher, and the requirements for updating faster than previous collaborative research using national data networks have increased. New approaches need to be developed to address these demands. Methods: In this article, we describe the use of the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) data model as a canonical data model and the automated transformation of clinical data to the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (PCORnet) and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDMs for data sharing and research collaboration on COVID-19. Results: FHIR data resources could be transformed to operational PCORnet and OMOP CDMs with minimal production delays through a combination of real-time and postprocessing steps, leveraging the FHIR data subscription feature. Conclusions: The approach leverages evolving standards for the availability of EHR data developed to facilitate data exchange under the 21st Century Cures Act and could greatly enhance the availability of standardized datasets for research. © 2021 The Author(s).

Methods: A retrospective review of the New York State Ambulatory Surgery and Services database was performed to identify patients who underwent elective hip arthroscopy between 2015 and 2016. Features included in initial models consisted of patient characteristics, medical comorbidities, and procedure-specific variables. Models were generated to predict total charges using 5 algorithms. Model performance was assessed by the root-mean-square error, root-mean-square logarithmic error, and coefficient of determination. Global variable importance and partial dependence curves were constructed to show the impact of each input feature on total charges. For performance benchmarking, the best candidate model was compared with a multivariate linear regression using the same input features. Results: A total of 5,121 patients were included. The median cost after hip arthroscopy was $19,720 (interquartile range, $12,399-$26,439). The gradient-boosted ensemble model showed the best performance (root-mean-square error, $3,800 [95% confidence interval, $3,700-$3,900]; logarithmic root-mean-square error, 0.249 [95% confidence interval, 0.24-0.26]; R2 = 0.73). Major cost drivers included total hours in facility less than 12 or more than 15, longer procedure time, performance of a labral repair, age younger than 30 years, Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI) of 1 or greater, African American race, residence in extreme urban and rural areas, and higher household and neighborhood income. Conclusions: The gradient-boosted ensemble model effectively predicted total charges after hip arthroscopy. Few modifiable variables were identified other than anesthesia type; nonmodifiable drivers of total charges included duration of care less than 12 hours or more than 15 hours, operating room time more than 100 minutes, age younger than 30 years, performance of a labral repair, and ECI greater than 0. Stratification of patients based on the ECI highlighted the increased financial risk borne by physicians via flat reimbursement schedules given variable degrees of comorbidities.

Infographics tailored with patients' own data can support comprehension of health status, but these have not been applied to asthma successfully. Objectives: This two-phased study developed and tested tailored infographics of (1) scores on the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ), a self-report measure of symptom burden, and (2) pulmonary function test (PFT) results. The infographics are intended for use as communication and adherence-promotion tools in clinical interactions. Methods: For both phases, participants (18+ years, English- or Spanish-speaking, persistent asthma) were recruited through two primary care clinics. In Phase I, we used a hybrid iterative participatory design process to refine prototype designs. In Phase II, we conducted individual comprehension assessment interviews with the finalized designs. Infographics were hand-tailored for each participant using their ACQ score and PFT results collected at the start of the interview. Two independent raters scored interview transcripts for GIST and verbatim comprehension based on a predetermined rubric. Results: The five Phase I design sessions led to final prototypes that participants (n = 21) considered appealing and easy to comprehend. All Phase II participants (n = 10) demonstrated complete GIST and verbatim comprehension. Participants reacted favorably to receiving their information via infographics and expressed intentions to engage in self-management behaviors (e.g., medication adherence, smoking cessation, weight loss, and review of their care plan) in response to the information. Conclusion: This study provides preliminary evidence that infographics can support comprehension of asthma control status and promote self-management intentions among adults with persistent asthma. Infographics can be programmed into electronic health records and/or standalone applications to allow for instant tailoring at the point of care. © 2019 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.",comprehension; consumer health; language/health literacy issues; medication adherence; patient; visual AIDS,Adult; Aged; Asthma; Computer Graphics; Female; Humans; Language; Male; Medication Adherence; Middle Aged; Primary Health Care; Respiratory Function Tests; Self Report; Surveys and Questionnaires; User-Computer Interface; adult; aged; asthma; computer graphics; computer interface; female; human; language; lung function test; male; medication compliance; middle aged; pathophysiology; primary health care; questionnaire; self report,Georg Thieme Verlag,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access

Methods: Guided by the Non-Adoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability (NASSS) framework, we conducted a user-centered design process involving English- and Spanish-speaking patients and providers affiliated with an academic medical center. We conducted a secondary analysis of interview transcripts from our prior study, new design sessions with patients and primary care providers (PCPs), and a survey of PCPs. We determined EHR integration requirements as part of the asthma app design and development process. Results: Analysis of 26 transcripts (21 patients, 5 providers) from the prior study, 21 new design sessions (15 patients, 6 providers), and survey responses from 55 PCPs (71% of 78) identified requirements. Patient-facing requirements included: 1- or 5-item symptom questionnaires each week, depending on asthma control; option to request a callback; ability to enter notes, triggers, and peak flows; and tips pushed via the app prior to a clinic visit. PCP-facing requirements included a clinician-facing dashboard accessible from the EHR and an EHR inbox message preceding the visit. PCP preferences diverged regarding graphical presentations of patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Nurse-facing requirements included callback requests sent as an EHR inbox message. Requirements were consistent for English- and Spanish-speaking patients. EHR integration required use of custom application programming interfaces (APIs). Conclusion: Using the NASSS framework to guide our user-centered design process, we identified patient and provider requirements for scaling an EHR-integrated remote symptom monitoring intervention in primary care. These requirements met the needs of patients and providers. Additional standards for PRO displays and EHR inbox APIs are needed to facilitate spread.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Since the implementation of screening is complex and underspecified, there is a need for systematic and theory-based strategies. Explore the implementation of lung cancer screening in primary care, in the context of integrating a decision aid into the electronic health record. Design implementation strategies that target hypothesized mechanisms of change and context-specific barriers. The study had two phases. The Qualitative Analysis phase included semi-structured interviews with primary care physicians to elicit key task behaviors (e.g., ordering a low-dose CT) and understand the underlying behavioral determinants (e.g., social influence). The Implementation Strategy Design phase consisted of defining implementation strategies and hypothesizing causal pathways to improve screening with a decision aid. Three key task behaviors and four behavioral determinants emerged from 14 interviews. Implementation strategies were designed to target multiple levels of influence. Strategies included increasing provider self-efficacy toward performing shared decision making and using the decision aid, improving provider performance expectancy toward ordering a low-dose CT, increasing social influence toward performing shared decision making and using the decision aid, and addressing key facilitators to using the decision aid. This study contributes knowledge about theoretical determinants of key task behaviors associated with lung cancer screening. We designed implementation strategies according to causal pathways that can be replicated and tested at other institutions. Future research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies and to determine the contexts in which they can be effectively applied.  © 2021 Society of Behavioral Medicine 2021.

Recent efforts by ASCO include the Data Standards and Interoperability Summit in 2016, which led to the Omics and Precision Oncology and Advancing Interoperability workshops. To facilitate improved patient care, several recommendations for data sharing and standardization were made to the community. Methods To address these recommendations, we developed SMART Cancer Navigator, a Web application that uses application programming interfaces to gather clinical and genomic data from 11 public knowledge bases ranging from basic to clinical content coverage; three (CIViC, ClinVar, and OncoKB) explicitly linked genomic variants to clinical factors such as prognosis and treatment selection. We illustrated the utility of this application by selecting one of the monthly case studies presented by the ASCO University Molecular Oncology Tumor Board: Ovarian Cancer (BRCA Mutation). We also performed analyses on information from the three clinico-genomic knowledge bases to corroborate previous work and illustrate the state of data sharing among publicly available resources. Results SMART Cancer Navigator aggregates and contextualizes data from 11 different knowledge bases and stores user queries in a lightweight Web application that can link into Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources-enabled electronic health records. Potentially relevant clinical trials and/or approved treatments were identified for three mutations found in a hypothetical patient with advanced ovarian cancer. A comparison of the three clinico-genomic knowledge bases indicated substantial differences in coverage at the gene and variant levels. Conclusion SMART Cancer Navigator has immediate relevance to practicing oncologists and others. Additional knowledge bases can be added without undue effort. As a first step toward utility, we generalized and disseminated the resulting implementation (https://smart-cancer-navigator.github.io) and data sets. © 2019 American Society of Clinical Oncology.",,,American Society of Clinical Oncology,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access

Results: AUROC was 0.913 for the TTB model, 0.788 for the TIPS model, and 0.879 for the UAE model. Maximum F1 score was 0.532 for the TTB model, 0.357 for the TIPS model, and 0.700 for the UAE model. The TTB model had the highest AUROC, while the UAE model had the highest F1 score. All models met the criteria for AUROC significance. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that machine learning models may suitably predict a variety of different clinically relevant outcomes, including procedure-specific complications, mortality, and length of stay. Performance of these models will improve as more high-quality IR data become available. © 2019 SIR",,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Child, Preschool; Data Mining; Databases, Factual; Female; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Iatrogenic Disease; Image-Guided Biopsy; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Inpatients; Length of Stay; Machine Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Pneumothorax; Portasystemic Shunt, Transjugular Intrahepatic; Radiography, Interventional; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Time Factors; United States; Uterine Artery Embolization; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; child; clinical decision support system; clinical outcome; computer assisted diagnosis; computer assisted tomography; female; hospital mortality; human; iatrogenic disease; image guided biopsy; infant; interventional radiology; length of stay; major clinical study; male; middle aged; newborn; pneumothorax; predictive value; priority journal; random forest; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt; transthoracic biopsy; uterine artery embolization; adverse event; data mining; factual database; hospital patient; iatrogenic disease; interventional radiology; machine learning; mortality; pneumothorax; preschool child; procedures; retrospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; time factor; United States; very elderly; young adult",Elsevier Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access

However, the mechanism of authentication used for proving the identity of entities in EHRs is based on the identifiers issued by centralized identity providers (IDPs). It may lead to a single point of failure, loss of privacy and lack of interoperability. A new wave of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials(VCs) data modelled by blockchain has made it possible to achieve entity authentication in a decentralized manner. In this study, a blockchain-based framework with decentralized identifiers for patient authentication and consent management for EHR access using verifiable credentials is proposed. It describes the process of DID generation and authentication credential setup along with workflows for issuing and verifying credentials in the EHR ecosystem. The framework is implemented using Hyperledger Indy blockchain and Aries library. The study evaluates the performance of proposed workflows in terms of scalability, efficiency, resource utilization and conducts security analysis. Specifically, the outcome of this study can be used to realize the decentralized identity management and authentication in EHR systems. © 2022 The Author(s).

Genomic findings must be robust and reproducible, and experimental data capture should adhere to findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) guiding principles. Moreover, effective precision medicine requires standardized reporting that extends beyond wet-lab procedures to computational methods. The BioCompute framework (https://w3id.org/biocompute/1.3.0) enables standardized reporting of genomic sequence data provenance, including provenance domain, usability domain, execution domain, verification kit, and error domain. This framework facilitates communication and promotes interoperability. Bioinformatics computation instances that employ the BioCompute framework are easily relayed, repeated if needed, and compared by scientists, regulators, test developers, and clinicians. Easing the burden of performing the aforementioned tasks greatly extends the range of practical application. Large clinical trials, precision medicine, and regulatory submissions require a set of agreed upon standards that ensures efficient communication and documentation of genomic analyses. The BioCompute paradigm and the resulting BioCompute Objects (BCOs) offer that standard and are freely accessible as a GitHub organization (https://github.com/biocompute-objects) following the “Open-Stand.org principles for collaborative open standards development.” With high-throughput sequencing (HTS) studies communicated using a BCO, regulatory agencies (e.g., Food and Drug Administration [FDA]), diagnostic test developers, researchers, and clinicians can expand collaboration to drive innovation in precision medicine, potentially decreasing the time and cost associated with next-generation sequencing workflow exchange, reporting, and regulatory reviews. © 2018, Public Library of Science.

Informatics approaches to EHR usability tend to focus on the extrinsic motivation associated with successful completion of clearly defined tasks in clinical workflows. Intrinsic motivation, which includes the need for autonomy, sense-making, creativity, connectedness, and mastery is not well supported by current designs and workflows. This piece examines existing research on the importance of 3 psychological drives in relation to healthcare technology: goal-based decision-making, sense-making, and agency/autonomy. Because these motives are ubiquitous, foundational to human functioning, automatic, and unconscious, they may be overlooked in technological interventions. The results are increased cognitive load, emotional distress, and unfulfilling workplace environments. Ultimately, we hope to stimulate new research on EHR design focused on expanding functionality to support intrinsic motivation, which, in turn, would decrease burnout and improve care.  © 2020 The Author(s).","clinician burnout; electronic health records, usability, cognitive load; motivation","Burnout, Professional; Cognition; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Motivation; Thinking; User-Centered Design; article; burnout; cognitive load; decision making; ego development; electronic health record; emotional stress; human; intrinsic motivation; meaning-making; motivation; thinking; usability; workplace; burnout; cognition; motivation; psychology; thinking",Oxford University Press,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access

Materials and Methods: We engaged a technical expert panel, conducted a scoping literature review, and interviewed key informants. We qualitatively analyzed literature and interview transcripts, mapping findings to the 4 phases for translating evidence into PC CDS interventions (Prioritizing, Authoring, Implementing, and Measuring) and to external factors. Results: We identified 12 challenges for PC CDS development. Lack of patient input was identified as a critical challenge. The key informants noted that patient input is critical to prioritizing topics for PC CDS and to ensuring that CDS aligns with patients' routine behaviors. Lack of patient-centered terminology standards was viewed as a challenge in authoring PC CDS. We found a dearth of CDS studies that measured clinical outcomes, creating significant gaps in our understanding of PC CDS' impact. Across all phases of CDS development, there is a lack of patient and provider trust and limited attention to patients' and providers' concerns. Discussion: These challenges suggest opportunities for advancing PC CDS. There are opportunities to develop industry-wide practices and standards to increase transparency, standardize terminologies, and incorporate patient input. There is also opportunity to engage patients throughout the PC CDS research process to ensure that outcome measures are relevant to their needs. Conclusion: Addressing these challenges and embracing these opportunities will help realize the promise of PC CDS-placing patients at the center of the healthcare system. © The Author(s) 2022.

Methods: We conducted a survey of genomic content use and its clinical delivery from representatives across eight institutions in the electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network and two institutions in the Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research (CSER) consortium in 2014. Results: Eleven responses representing distinct projects across ten sites showed heterogeneity in how content is being delivered, with provider-facing content primarily delivered via the electronic health record (EHR) (n=10), and paper/pamphlets as the leading mode for patient-facing content (n=9). There was general agreement (91%) that new content is needed for patients and providers specific to genomics, and that while aspects of this content could be shared across institutions there remain site-specific needs (73% in agreement). Conclusion: This work identifies a need for the improved access to and expansion of information resources to support genomic medicine, and opportunities for content developers and EHR vendors to partner with institutions to develop needed resources, and streamline their use – such as a central content site in multiple modalities while implementing approaches to allow for site-specific customization. © Schattauer 2016.",Clinical decision support; Education; Electronic health records; Genetics; Medicine,Electronic Health Records; Genomics; Humans; Sequence Analysis; electronic health record; genomics; human; sequence analysis,Schattauer GmbH,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access

In this literature review, we investigated the existing work on heterogeneous health data integration as well as the methods of utilizing the integrated health data. Our search was narrowed down to 32 articles for analysis. The integration approaches in the reviewed articles were classified into three classifications, and the utilization approaches were classified into five classifications. The topic of health data integration is still under debate and problems are far from being resolved. This review suggests the need for a more efficient way to invoke the various services for aggregating health data, as well as a more effective way to integrate the aggregated health data for supporting collaborative utilization.

Method An international team performed secondary research on how apps are being used and on common pathways to remuneration. Results The uses of apps today and in the future are reviewed, the nature of the value delivered by apps is summarised and an overview of app reimbursement in the USA and other countries is provided. Recommendations regarding how payments might be made for apps in the future are discussed. Conclusions Currently, apps are being reimbursed through channels with other original purposes. There may be a need to develop an app-specific channel for reimbursement which is analogous to the channels used for devices, drugs and laboratory tests.

However, the number of clusters and key phenotypic features have been subjectively selected, reducing the reliability of the phenotyping results. Here, to minimize such subjective decisions for highly confident phenotyping, we develop a multimetric phenotyping framework by combining supervised and unsupervised machine learning. This clusters 2277 OSA patients to six phenotypes based on their multidimensional polysomnography (PSG) data. Importantly, these new phenotypes show statistically different comorbidity development for OSA-related cardio-neuro-metabolic diseases, unlike the conventional single-metric apnea–hypopnea index-based phenotypes. Furthermore, the key features of highly comorbid phenotypes were identified through supervised learning rather than subjective choice. These results can also be used to automatically phenotype new patients and predict their comorbidity risks solely based on their PSG data. The phenotyping framework based on the combination of unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods can also be applied to other complex, heterogeneous diseases for phenotyping patients and identifying important features for high-risk phenotypes. © 2021, The Author(s).",,"Adult; Cluster Analysis; Comorbidity; Humans; Middle Aged; Phenotype; Polysomnography; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive; Supervised Machine Learning; Unsupervised Machine Learning; adult; cluster analysis; comorbidity; human; middle aged; pathophysiology; phenotype; polysomnography; procedures; sleep disordered breathing; supervised machine learning; unsupervised machine learning",Nature Research,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

The modeling capability of FHIR in standardizing cancer data has been gaining increasing attention by the cancer research informatics community. However, few studies have been conducted to examine the capability of FHIR in electronic data capture (EDC) applications for effective cancer clinical trials. The objective of this study was to design, develop, and evaluate an FHIR-based method that enables the automation of the case report forms (CRFs) population for cancer clinical trials using real-world electronic health records (EHRs). MATERIALS AND METHODS We developed an FHIR-based computational pipeline of EDC with a case study for modeling colorectal cancer trials. We first leveraged an existing FHIR-based cancer profile to represent EHR data of patients with colorectal cancer, and then we used the FHIR Questionnaire and QuestionnaireResponse resources to represent the CRFs and their data population. To test the accuracy of and overall quality of the computational pipeline, we used synoptic reports of 287 Mayo Clinic patients with colorectal cancer from 2013 to 2019 with standard measures of precision, recall, and F1 score. RESULTS Using the computational pipeline, a total of 1,037 synoptic reports were successfully converted as the instances of the FHIR-based cancer profile. The average accuracy for converting all data elements (excluding tumor perforation) of the cancer profile was 0.99, using 200 randomly selected records. The average F1 score for populating nine questions of the CRFs in a real-world colorectal cancer trial was 0.95, using 100 randomly selected records. CONCLUSION We demonstrated that it is feasible to populate CRFs with EHR data in an automated manner with satisfactory performance. The outcome of the study provides helpful insight into future directions in implementing FHIR-based EDC applications for modern cancer clinical trials. © 2020 by American Society of Clinical Oncology",,Algorithms; Clinical Trials as Topic; Colorectal Neoplasms; Electronic Data Processing; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Medical Informatics; Software; Surveys and Questionnaires; Article; automation; case report form; case study; clinical trial (topic); colorectal cancer; electronic health record; Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources; human; information processing; population research; priority journal; proof of concept; questionnaire; algorithm; colorectal tumor; medical informatics; procedures; software,American Society of Clinical Oncology,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access

Originally designed for operational functions including billing and regulatory compliance, these systems have had unintended consequences including increased exam room documentation, divided attention during the visit, and use of scribes to alleviate documentation burdens. In an age in which technology is ubiquitous in everyday life, we must re-envision healthcare technology to support both clinical operations and, above all, the patient-clinician relationship. We present 6 habits for designing user-centered health technologies: (1) put patient care first, (2) assemble a team with the right skills, (3) relentlessly ask WHY, (4) keep it simple, (5) be Darwinian, and (6) don't lose the forest for the trees.

The following areas of need were identified: 1) omics and precision oncology, 2) advancing interoperability, 3) patient engagement, and 4) value-based oncology. To begin to address these issues, ASCO convened two complementary workshops: the Omics and Precision Oncology Workshop in October 2016 and the Advancing Interoperability Workshop in December 2016. A common goal was to address the complexity, enormity, and rapidly changing nature of genomic information, which existing electronic health records are ill equipped to manage. The subject matter experts invited to the Omics and Precision Oncology Workgroup were tasked with the responsibility of determining a specific, limited need that could be addressed by a software application (app) in the short-term future, using currently available genomic knowledge bases. Hence, the scope of this workshop was to determine the basic functionality of one app that could serve as a test case for app development. The goal of the second workshop, described separately, was to identify the specifications for such an app. This approach was chosen both to facilitate the development of a useful app and to help ASCO and oncologists better understand the mechanics, difficulties, and gaps in genomic clinical decision support tool development. In this article, we discuss the key challenges and recommendations identified by the workshop participants. Our hope is to narrow the gap between the practicing oncologist and ongoing national efforts to provide precision oncology and value-based care to cancer patients.

This report details the lessons learned during the integration of a patient decision aid - prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing for prostate cancer screening - into our users’ standard EHR workflow for a small usability assessment. Materials and Methods: This feasibility study included two steps. First we enabled realtime, secure bidirectional data exchange between the mobile app and EHR for 14 data elements, and second we pilot tested the production environment app with 9 primary care patients aged 60–65 years. Our primary usability metric was a net promoter score (NPS), based on users’ recommendation of the app to a friend or family member; we also assessed the proportion of users who 1) updated their prostate cancer risk factor information present in the EHR and 2) submitted more than one unique response regarding their preference to have PSA testing. Results: The seven web services necessary to read and write data required considerable configuration, but successfully delivered risk factor-specific educational content and recorded patients’ values and decision preference directly within the EHR. Seven of the 9 patients (78%) would recommend this app to a friend/family member (NPS = 55.6%), one patient used the app to update risk factor information, and 4/9 (44%) changed their decision preference while using the app. Conclusions: It is feasible to implement a decision aid directly into users’ standard EHR workflow for limited usability testing. Broad scale implementation may have a positive effect on patient engagement and improve shared decision making, but several challenges exist with proprietary EHR vendor application programming interfaces (API)s. © 2019",Clinical informatics; Decision making; Electronic health records; mobile applications,Aged; Decision Making; Early Detection of Cancer; Electronic Health Records; Feasibility Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mobile Applications; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Prostatic Neoplasms; User-Computer Interface; Antigens; Application programming interfaces (API); Decision support systems; Diagnosis; Diseases; Electronic data interchange; Integration testing; Mobile computing; Planning; Records management; Risk assessment; Urology; Web services; prostate specific antigen; prostate specific antigen; Clinical informatics; Educational contents; Electronic health record; Mobile applications; Production environments; Prostate specific antigen; Shared decision makings; Usability assessment; adult; aged; Article; cancer patient; cancer screening; comparative study; electronic health record; family history; feasibility study; general practitioner; human; male; medical history; mobile application; primary medical care; priority journal; promoter region; prostate cancer; risk factor; shared decision making; social media; computer interface; decision making; early cancer diagnosis; feasibility study; middle aged; mobile application; prostate tumor; Decision making,Elsevier Ireland Ltd,,,,Article,Final,

An SSI detected as part of the American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Program was used as the reference standard. We developed a rules-based NLP system (Easy Clinical Information Extractor [CIE]-SSI) for operative event-level detection of SSIs using an training cohort (4574 operative events) from 1 healthcare system and then conducted internal validation on a blind cohort from the same healthcare system (1850 operative events) and external validation on a blind cohort from the second healthcare system (15,360 operative events). EasyCIE-SSI performance was measured using sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver-operating-curve (AUC).Results:The prevalence of SSI was 4% and 5% in the internal and external validation corpora. In internal validation, EasyCIE-SSI had a sensitivity, specificity, AUC of 94%, 88%, 0.912 for the detection of SSI, respectively. In external validation, EasyCIE-SSI had sensitivity, specificity, AUC of 79%, 92%, 0.852 for the detection of SSI, respectively. The sensitivity of EasyCIE-SSI decreased in clean, skin/subcutaneous, and outpatient procedures in the external validation compared to internal validation.Conclusion:Automated surveillance of SSIs can be achieved using NLP of clinical notes with high sensitivity and specificity. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Integration of cancer clinical data and cancer genomic information poses unique challenges, because of the high volume and complexity of clinical data, as well as the heterogeneity and instability of cancer genome data when compared with germline data. Current information models of clinical and genomic data are not sufficiently expressive to represent individual observations and to aggregate those observations into longitudinal summaries over the course of cancer care. These models are acutely needed to support the development of systems and tools for generating the so called clinical ""deep phenotype"" of individual cancer patients, a process which remains almost entirely manual in cancer research and precision medicine. Methods: Reviews of existing ontologies and interviews with cancer researchers were used to inform iterative development of a cancer phenotype information model. We translated a subset of the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) models into the OWL 2 Description Logic (DL) representation, and added extensions as needed for modeling cancer phenotypes with terms derived from the NCI Thesaurus. Models were validated with domain experts and evaluated against competency questions. Results: The DeepPhe Information model represents cancer phenotype data at increasing levels of abstraction from mention level in clinical documents to summaries of key events and findings. We describe the model using breast cancer as an example, depicting methods to represent phenotypic features of cancers, tumors, treatment regimens, and specific biologic behaviors that span the entire course of a patient's disease. Conclusions: We present a multi-scale information model for representing individual document mentions, document level classifications, episodes along a disease course, and phenotype summarization, linking individual observations to high-level summaries in support of subsequent integration and analysis. © 2016 The Author(s).",Cancer; Deep phenotyping; Information extraction; Information model,"Computational Biology; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Neoplasms; Phenotype; biology; classification; human; neoplasm; phenotype; procedures; theoretical model",BioMed Central Ltd,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

The healthcare research ecosystem would benefit if tools and projects could be adopted independently from the underlying data model. Here, we introduce the concept of a reusable application programming interface (API) for healthcare and show that the i2b2 API can be adapted to support diverse patient-centric data models. Materials and Methods We develop methodology for extending i2b2's pre-existing API to query additional data models, using i2b2's recent ""multi-fact-Table querying"" feature. Our method involves developing data-model-specific i2b2 ontologies and mapping these to query non-standard table structure. Results We implement this methodology to query OMOP and PCORnet models, which we validate with the i2b2 query tool. We implement the entire PCORnet data model and a five-domain subset of the OMOP model. We also demonstrate that additional, ancillary data model columns can be modeled and queried as i2b2 ""modifiers."" Discussion i2b2's REST API can be used to query multiple healthcare data models, enabling shared tooling to have a choice of backend data stores. This enables separation between data model and software tooling for some of the more popular open analytic data models in healthcare. Conclusion This methodology immediately allows querying OMOP and PCORnet using the i2b2 API. It is released as an open-source set of Docker images, and also on the i2b2 community wiki. © © The Author(s) 2018.

One solution is to train models in a distributed manner that involves many parties in the process. However, sometimes certain parties are not trustable, and in this project, we aim to propose an alternative method to traditional federated learning with central analyzer in order to conduct training in a situation without a trustable central analyzer. The proposed algorithm is called “federated machine learning with anonymous random hybridization (abbreviated as ‘FeARH’)”, using mainly hybridization algorithm to degenerate the integration of connections between medical record data and models’ parameters by adding randomization into the parameter sets shared to other parties.

To incentivize data exchange within the Internet of Things (IoT) framework, we need to ensure data sovereignty by facilitating secure data exchange between trusted parties. The security and reliability of data-sharing infrastructure require a community of trust. Therefore, this paper introduces an encryption frame based on data fragmentation. It also presents a novel, deterministic grey-scale optical encryption scheme based on fundamental mathematics. The objective is to use encryption as the underlying measure to make the data unintelligible while exploiting fragmentation to break down sensitive relationships between attributes. Thus, sensitive data distributed in separate data repositories for decryption and reconstruction using interpolation by knowing polynomial coefficients and personal values from the DBMS Database Management System.

Interactive and flexible software that interfaces directly with EHR data structured around a common data model (CDM) could accelerate more EHR-based research by making the data more accessible to researchers who lack computational expertise and/or domain knowledge. Results: We present PatientExploreR, an extensible application built on the R/Shiny framework that interfaces with a relational database of EHR data in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership CDM format. PatientExploreR produces patient-level interactive and dynamic reports and facilitates visualization of clinical data without any programming required. It allows researchers to easily construct and export patient cohorts from the EHR for analysis with other software. This application could enable easier exploration of patient-level data for physicians and researchers. PatientExploreR can incorporate EHR data from any institution that employs the CDM for users with approved access. The software code is free and open source under the MIT license, enabling institutions to install and users to expand and modify the application for their own purposes. Availability and implementation: PatientExploreR can be freely obtained from GitHub: https://github.com/BenGlicksberg/PatientExploreR. We provide instructions for how researchers with approved access to their institutional EHR can use this package.

Methods: A type III hybrid implementation-effectiveness trial. Uptake and implementation processes were evaluated using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. Results: One hundred (58%) primary care providers and 2514 (7.8%) adult patients enrolled. Enrolled patients were 69% female, 22% minority, and 32% Medicare/Medicaid. Compared with their respective clinic’s population, patient-participants were more likely to be female (69 vs. 59%), older (mean age 57 vs. 49), and Caucasian (88 vs. 69%) (all p values <0.001). Female (81.3% of females vs. 78.5% of males, p value = 0.018) and Caucasian (Caucasians 90.4% vs. minority 84.1%, p value = 0.02) patient-participants were more likely to complete the study once enrolled. Patient-participant survey responses indicated MeTree was easy to use (95%), and patient-participants would recommend it to family/friends (91%). Minorities and those with less education reported greatest benefit. Enrolled providers reflected demographics of underlying provider population. Conclusion: Family health history–based risk assessment can be effectively implemented in diverse primary care settings and can effectively engage patients and providers.

Materials and Methods: We designed a chronic disease management application using the technology framework known as SMART on FHIR (Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technologies on Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources). We used mixed methods to obtain user feedback on a prototype to support ambulatory providers managing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Each participant managed 2 patient scenarios using the regular EHR with and without access to our prototype in block-randomized order. The primary outcome was the percentage of expert-recommended ideal care tasks completed. Timing, keyboard and mouse use, and participant surveys were also collected. User experiences were captured using a retrospective think-aloud interview analyzed by concept coding. Results: With our prototype, the 13 participants completed more recommended care (81% vs 48%; P < .001) and recommended tasks per minute (0.8 vs 0.6; P ¼ .03) over longer sessions (7.0 minutes vs 5.4 minutes; P ¼ .006). Keystrokes per task were lower with the prototype (6 vs 18; P < .001). Qualitative themes elicited included the desire for reliable presentation of information which matches participants’ mental models of disease and for intuitive navigation in order to decrease cognitive load. Discussion: Participants completed more recommended care by taking more time when using our prototype. Interviews identified a tension between using the inefficient but familiar EHR vs learning to use our novel prototype. Concept coding of user feedback generated actionable insights. Conclusions: Mixed methods can support the design and evaluation of SMART on FHIR EHR add-on applications by enhancing understanding of the user experience.

Over 70% epilepsy patients can live normally if their seizures can be controlled. For this, many factors should be tracked and managed, but doing so is hard because of individual differences. There are mobile applications to help track these factors; however, no application covers crucial factors comprehensively, and they are complicated to use. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a mobile epilepsy management application covering crucial factors comprehensively in a user-friendly way. We evaluated the pilot version with a usability and satisfaction survey and an interview. Methods: We established a task force comprising professionals from various fields who participated in all processes of this research. Existing service analysis and professional interviews were conducted to draw a function list. User interface and graphic user interface were designed under the supervision of the task force. After developing the application's pilot version, usability and satisfaction of the application were evaluated with eight patients and caregivers through scenario-based usability test, satisfaction survey, and interview. Results: All existing mobile epilepsy management applications provide seizure and medication diary functions. We decided to provide six main functions: seizure diary, medication reminder, appointments, outpatient survey, education materials, and personal dashboard (My epilepsy). We also integrated the application with the hospital's electronic health record system. To simplify usability, frequently used and relatively important functions are located in the main page as “seizure recording” and “medication diary.” Additionally, when designing graphics, art therapy was used to enhance psychological stability. For evaluation, eight participants were recruited. In scenario-based tasks, among 10 tasks, all participants completed six tasks. However, only 37.5% participants could record seizures in detail. System Usability Scale score was 84.5 points, indicating that the system was satisfactory. Conclusion: This study confirmed that patients’ satisfaction of this application were high. Additionally, it helped them record their seizures accurately, which is very useful for seizure trend analysis, discovering seizure trigger factors, and ensuring efficient management of epilepsy. Through integration with the electronic health record, patient medical information could be utilized to guide physicians’ decision-making for setting future medical treatment plan and could contribute greatly to the overall management of epilepsy. © 2019",Electronic medical record; Epilepsy; Medication; Mobile application; Seizure,Adult; Anticonvulsants; Disease Management; Electronic Health Records; Epilepsy; Female; Humans; Male; Medication Adherence; Mobile Applications; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Patient Satisfaction; Physicians; Seizures; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult; eHealth; Information management; Medical computing; Mobile computing; Neurology; Patient treatment; Records management; Surveys; Usability engineering; User interfaces; anticonvulsive agent; Electronic medical record; Epilepsy; Medication; Mobile applications; Seizure; adult; art therapy; Article; attitude to illness; brain computer interface; caregiver; clinical article; controlled study; electronic health record; emotion; epilepsy; female; human; interview; male; medication compliance; mental health; mobile application; negative feedback; outpatient; patient compliance; patient satisfaction; physical development; priority journal; quality of life; seizure; young adult; disease management; electronic health record; epilepsy; mobile application; patient attitude; physician; psychology; questionnaire; seizure; Decision making,Elsevier Ireland Ltd,,,,Article,Final,

However, completion of these outcome measures can be inconsistent and challenging. We hypothesized that sociodemographic variables are associated with the completion of PROM questionnaires. The purposes of the present study were to calculate the completion rate of assigned PROM forms and to identify sociodemographic and other variables associated with completion to help guide improved collection efforts.Methods:All new orthopaedic patients at a single academic medical center were identified from 2016 to 2020. On the basis of subspecialty and presenting condition, patients were assigned certain PROMIS forms and legacy PROMs. Demographic and clinical information was abstracted from the electronic medical record. Bivariate analyses were performed to compare characteristics among those who completed assigned PROMs and those who did not. A multivariable logistic regression model was created to determine which variables were associated with successful completion of assigned PROMs.Results:Of the 219,891 new patients, 88,052 (40%) completed all assigned PROMs. Patients who did not activate their internet-based patient portal had a 62% increased likelihood of not completing assigned PROMs (odds ratio [OR], 1.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.58 to 1.66; p < 0.001). Non-English-speaking patients had a 90% (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.82 to 2.00; p < 0.001) increased likelihood of not completing assigned PROMs at presentation. Older patients (≥65 years of age) and patients of Black race had a 23% (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.19 to 1.27; p < 0.001) and 24% (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.19 to 1.30; p < 0.001) increased likelihood of not completing assigned PROMs, respectively.Conclusions:The rate of completion of PROMs varies according to sociodemographic variables. This variability could bias clinical outcomes research in orthopaedic surgery. The present study highlights the need to uniformly increase completion rates so that outcomes research incorporates truly representative cohorts of patients treated. Furthermore, the use of these PROMs to guide health-care policy decisions necessitates a representative patient distribution to avoid bias in the health-care system.Level of Evidence:Prognostic Level III.

However, few health systems have successfully converted this abundance of data into useful information or knowledge for safety improvement. In this paper, we use a case study involving a project on missed/delayed follow-up of test results to discuss real-world challenges in using EHR data for patient safety research. We identify three types of challenges that pose as barriers to advance patient safety improvement research: 1) gaining approval to access/review EHR data; 2) interpreting EHR data; 3) working with local IT/EHR personnel. We discuss the complexity of these challenges, all of which are unlikely to be unique to this project, and outline some key next steps that must be taken to support research that uses EHR data to improve safety. We recognize that all organizations face competing priorities between clinical operations and research. However, to leverage EHRs and their abundant data for patient safety improvement research, many current data access and security policies and procedures must be rewritten and standardized across health care organizations. These efforts are essential to help make EHRs and EHR data useful for progress in our journey to safer health care. © 2016",,Delayed Diagnosis; Electronic Health Records; Health Services Research; Humans; Medical Informatics; Patient Safety; Qualitative Research; Quality Improvement; algorithm; Article; electronic health record; follow up; health care facility; health care organization; health care planning; health care system; human; patient safety; priority journal; delayed diagnosis; electronic health record; health services research; medical informatics; qualitative research; total quality management,Elsevier B.V.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access

Academic/practical relevance: In a constrained hospital environment, forecasts on patient demand patterns could help match capacity and demand and improve hospital operations. Methodology: We use data from 63,432 admissions at a large academic hospital (50% female, median age 64 years old, median length of stay 3.12 days). We construct an expertise-driven patient representation on top of their EHR data and apply a broad class of machine learning methods to predict several aspects of patient flows. Results: With a unique patient representation, we estimate short-term discharges, identify long-stay patients, predict discharge destination, and anticipate flows in and out of intensive care units with accuracy in the 80%+ range. More importantly, we implement this machine learning pipeline into the EHR system of the hospital and construct prediction-informed dashboards to support daily bed placement decisions. Managerial implications: Our study demonstrates that interpretable machine learning techniques combined with EHR data can be used to provide visibility on patient flows. Our approach provides an alternative to deep learning techniques that is equally accurate, interpretable, frugal in data and computational power, and production ready. © 2021 INFORMS.",flow management; hospital operations; interpretability; machine learning; predictive analytics,Decision making; Deep learning; Intensive care units; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Accurate prediction; Decisions makings; Electronic health; Flow management; Health records; Hospital operations; Interpretability; Machine-learning; Patient flow; Problem definition; Predictive analytics,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access

The present study used existing data sets from large musculoskeletal trauma trials to address the following study questions: (1) Do ML models produce better probability estimates than logistic regression models? (2) Are ML models influenced by different variables than logistic regression models?Methods:We created ML and logistic regression models that estimated the probability of a specific fracture (posterior malleolar involvement in distal spiral tibial shaft and ankle fractures, scaphoid fracture, and distal radial fracture) or adverse event (subsequent surgery [after distal biceps repair or tibial shaft fracture], surgical site infection, and postoperative delirium) using 9 data sets from published musculoskeletal trauma studies. Each data set was split into training (80%) and test (20%) subsets. Fivefold cross-validation of the training set was used to develop the ML models. The best-performing model was then assessed in the independent testing data. Performance was assessed by (1) discrimination (c-statistic), (2) calibration (slope and intercept), and (3) overall performance (Brier score).Results:The mean c-statistic was 0.01 higher for the logistic regression models compared with the best ML models for each data set (range, -0.01 to 0.06). There were fewer variables strongly associated with variation in the ML models, and many were dissimilar from those in the logistic regression models.Conclusions:The observation that ML models produce probability estimates comparable with logistic regression models for binary events in musculoskeletal trauma suggests that their benefit may be limited in this context. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

With the introduction of the open source ResearchKit, Apple provides a framework for researchers to inform and consent research subjects, and to readily collect personal health data and patient reported outcomes (PRO) from distributed populations. However, being research backend agnostic, ResearchKit does not provide data transmission facilities, leaving research apps disconnected from the health system.

Our aim was to build a toolchain that allows easy and secure integration of personal health and PRO data into an open source platform widely adopted across 140 academic medical centers. We present C3-PRO: the Consent, Contact, and Community framework for Patient Reported Outcomes. This open source toolchain connects, in a standards-compliant fashion, any ResearchKit app to the widely-used clinical research infrastructure Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2). C3-PRO leverages the emerging health data standard Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). © 2016 Pfiffner et al.

If not successfully treated at this age, they often persist into adulthood, exerting a great social and economic toll. Given the long-term impact, finding ways to increase the success and cost-effectiveness of mental health care is a pressing need. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based treatment for mood and anxiety disorders throughout the lifespan. Mental health technologies can be used to make such treatments more successful by delivering them in a format that increases utilization. Young people embrace technologies, and many want to actively manage their mental health. Mobile software apps have the potential to improve youth adherence to CBT and, in turn, improve outcomes of treatment. Objective: The purpose of this project is to improve homework adherence in CBT for youth anxiety and/or depression. The objectives are to (1) design and optimize the usability of a mobile app for delivering the homework component of CBT for youth with anxiety and/or depression, (2) assess the app's impact on homework completion, and (3) implement the app in CBT programs. We hypothesize that homework adherence will be greater in the app group than in the no-app group. Methods: Phase 1: exploratory interviews will be conducted with adolescents and therapists familiar with CBT to obtain views and perspectives on the requirements and features of a usable app and the challenges involved in implementation. The information obtained will guide the design of a prototype. The prototype will be optimized via think-aloud procedures involving an iterative process of evaluation, modification, and re-evaluation, culminating in a fully functional version of the prototype that is ready for optimization in a clinical context. Phase 2: a usability study will be conducted to optimize the prototype in the context of treatment at clinics that provide CBT treatment for youth with anxiety and/or depression. This phase will result in a usable app that is ready to be tested for its effectiveness in increasing homework adherence. Phase 3: a pragmatic clinical trial will be conducted at several clinics to evaluate the impact of the app on homework adherence. Participants in the app group are expected to show greater homework completion than those in the no-app group. Results: Phase 3 will be completed by September 2019. Conclusions: The app will be a unique adjunct to treatment for adolescents in CBT, focusing on both anxiety and depression, developed in partnership with end users at every stage from design to implementation, customizable for different cognitive profiles, and designed with depression symptom tracking measures for youth made interoperable with electronic medical records. © Pamela Wilansky, J Mikael Eklund, Tracy Milner, David Kreindler, Amy Cheung, Tim Kovacs, Shahin Shooshtari, Arlene Astell, Arto Ohinmaa, Joanna Henderson, John Strauss, Rosemary S L Mills.

FHIR resources are defined in a specialized modeling language. FHIR instances can currently be represented in either XML or JSON. The FHIR and Semantic Web communities are developing a third FHIR instance representation format in Resource Description Framework (RDF). Shape Expressions (ShEx), a formal RDF data constraint language, is a candidate for describing and validating the FHIR RDF representation. Objective Create a FHIR to ShEx model transformation and assess its ability to describe and validate FHIR RDF data. Methods We created the methods and tools that generate the ShEx schemas modeling the FHIR to RDF specification being developed by HL7 ITS/W3C RDF Task Force, and evaluated the applicability of ShEx in the description and validation of FHIR to RDF transformations. Results The ShEx models contributed significantly to workgroup consensus. Algorithmic transformations from the FHIR model to ShEx schemas and FHIR example data to RDF transformations were incorporated into the FHIR build process. ShEx schemas representing 109 FHIR resources were used to validate 511 FHIR RDF data examples from the Standards for Trial Use (STU 3) Ballot version. We were able to uncover unresolved issues in the FHIR to RDF specification and detect 10 types of errors and root causes in the actual implementation. The FHIR ShEx representations have been included in the official FHIR web pages for the STU 3 Ballot version since September 2016. Discussion ShEx can be used to define and validate the syntax of a FHIR resource, which is complementary to the use of RDF Schema (RDFS) and Web Ontology Language (OWL) for semantic validation. Conclusion ShEx proved useful for describing a standard model of FHIR RDF data. The combination of a formal model and a succinct format enabled comprehensive review and automated validation. © 2017",HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR); Quality assurance; Resource Description Framework (RDF); Semantic web technology; Shape Expressions (ShEx),Algorithms; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Internet; Semantics; Health care; Interoperability; Metadata; Modeling languages; Ontology; Quality assurance; Specifications; Websites; Algorithmic transformation; Electronic healthcare; Healthcare Interoperability; Resource description framework; Semantic validations; Semantic Web technology; Shape Expressions (ShEx); Web ontology language; analytical error; Article; computer language; conceptual framework; electronic health record; HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource; Internet; learning algorithm; mathematical model; ontology; Resource Description Framework; semantics; Shape Expression; software validation; algorithm; electronic health record; human; Semantic Web,Academic Press Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access

Yet the wealth of data generated from the many sensors on these wearables and smartwatches has not yet transformed routine clinical care. One central reason for this gap between data and clinical insights is the lack of transparency and standards around data generated from mobile device that hinders interoperability and reproducibility. The clinical informatics community has offered solutions via the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard which facilities electronic health record interoperability but is less developed towards precision temporal contextually-tagged sensor measurements generated from today's ubiquitous mobile devices. In this paper we explore the opportunities and challenges of various theoretical approaches towards FHIR compatible digital phenotyping, and offer a concrete example implementing one such framework as an Application Programming Interface (API) for the opensource mindLAMP platform.

The gold standard diagnosis method is polysomnography, which estimates disease severity through the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI). However, this is expensive and not widely accessible to the public. For effective screening, this work implements machine learning algorithms for classification of OSA. The model is trained with routinely acquired clinical data of 1479 records from the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort dataset. Extracted features from the electronic health records include patient demographics, laboratory blood reports, physical measurements, habitual sleep history, comorbidities, and general health questionnaire scores. For distinguishing between OSA and non-OSA patients, feature selection methods reveal the primary important predictors as waist-to-height ratio, waist circumference, neck circumference, bodymass index, lipid accumulation product, excessive daytime sleepiness, daily snoring frequency and snoring volume. Optimal hyperparameters were selected using a hybrid tuning method consisting of Bayesian Optimization and Genetic Algorithms through a five-fold cross-validation strategy. Support vector machines achieved the highest evaluation scores with accuracy: 68.06%, sensitivity: 88.76%, specificity: 40.74%, F1-score: 75.96%, PPV: 66.36% and NPV: 73.33%. We conclude that routine clinical data can be useful in prioritization of patient referral for further sleep studies. © 2021 by the authors.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether an EHR add-on app for neonatal bilirubin management can save clinicians time and improve patient care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This quality improvement study was conducted at the University of Utah Health Well Baby nursery and outpatient clinics and consisted of 4 substudies: (1) time savings were estimated in an experimental task-timing study comparing the time required for physicians to manage newborns’ bilirubin levels with and without the add-on app, (2) app use was estimated from app logs, (3) health care use measures and guideline compliance were compared retrospectively before and after the intervention, and (4) clinician-perceived usability was measured through System Usability Scale surveys. The study took place between April 1, 2016, and September 3, 2019. Data analyses were conducted from October 30, 2018, to September 23, 2019. INTERVENTIONS At baseline, clinicians used a manual approach to ensure compliance with an evidence-based clinical guideline for neonatal bilirubin management. To facilitate guideline compliance, an EHR add-on app that automatically retrieves, organizes, and visualizes relevant patient data was developed. The app provides patient-specific assessments and recommendations, including the risk of rebound hyperbilirubinemia following phototherapy based on a predictive model. The add-on app was integrated with the University of Utah Health EHR on April 12, 2017. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Clinician time savings, app use, health care use measures, guideline-compliant phototherapy ordering, and perceived usability as measured by the System Usability Scale survey. The survey is composed of 10 statements with responses ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The survey results in a single score ranging from 0 to 100, with ratings described as worst imaginable (mean System Usability Scale score, 12.5), awful (20.3), poor (35.7), okay (50.9), good (71.4), excellent (85.5), and best imaginable (90.9). RESULTS In 2018, the application was used 20 516 times by clinicians for 91.84% of eligible newborns. Use of the app saved 66 seconds for bilirubin management tasks compared with a commonly used tool (95% CI, 53-79 seconds; P < .001). Following the intervention, health care use rates remained stable, while orders for clinically appropriate phototherapy during hospitalization increased for newborns with bilirubin levels above the guideline-recommended threshold (odds ratio, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.16-2.90; P = .009). Surveys indicated excellent usability (System Usability Scale score, 83.90; 95% CI, 81.49-86.31). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Well-designed EHR add-on apps may save clinicians time and improve patient care. If time-saving apps, such as the bilirubin app, were implemented widely across institutions and care domains, the potential association with improved patient care and clinician efficiency could be significant. The University of Utah Health bilirubin app is being prepared for release into EHR app stores as free-to-use software. © 2019 Kawamoto K et al.",,"Bilirubin; Efficiency; Electronic Health Records; Female; Guideline Adherence; Health Care Surveys; Humans; Hyperbilirubinemia; Infant, Newborn; Male; Mobile Applications; Pediatrics; Quality Improvement; Quality of Health Care; Retrospective Studies; Time Factors; bilirubin; blood; electronic health record; female; health care quality; health care survey; human; hyperbilirubinemia; male; mobile application; newborn; pediatrics; productivity; protocol compliance; retrospective study; time factor; total quality management",American Medical Association,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

However, there are still many challenges to achieving this vision. The goal of this project was to develop and apply methods for enhancing chronic disease care using AI. Methods Using a dataset of 27,904 patients with diabetes, an analytical method was developed and validated for generating a treatment pathway graph which consists of models that predict the likelihood of alternate treatment strategies achieving care goals. An AI-driven clinical decision support system (CDSS) integrated with the electronic health record (EHR) was developed by encapsulating the prediction models in an OpenCDS Web service module and delivering the model outputs through a SMART on FHIR (Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technologies on Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) web-based dashboard. This CDSS enables clinicians and patients to review relevant patient parameters, select treatment goals, and review alternate treatment strategies based on prediction results. Results The proposed analytical method outperformed previous machine-learning algorithms on prediction accuracy. The CDSS was successfully integrated with the Epic EHR at the University of Utah. Conclusion A predictive analytics-based CDSS was developed and successfully integrated with the EHR through standards-based interoperability frameworks. The approach used could potentially be applied to many other chronic conditions to bring AI-driven CDSS to the point of care. © 2021.

Pursuing digital feasibility queries on available patient data registries has proven to be an excellent way of reusing existing real-world data sources. To support multicentric research, these feasibility queries should be designed and implemented to run across multiple sites and securely access local data. Working across hospitals usually involves working with different data formats and vocabularies. Recently, the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard was developed by Health Level Seven to address this concern and describe patient data in a standardized format. The Medical Informatics Initiative in Germany has committed to this standard and created data integration centers, which convert existing data into the FHIR format at each hospital. This partially solves the interoperability problem; however, a distributed feasibility query platform for the FHIR standard is still missing. Objective: This study described the design and implementation of the components involved in creating a cross-hospital feasibility query platform for researchers based on FHIR resources. This effort was part of a large COVID-19 data exchange platform and was designed to be scalable for a broad range of patient data. Methods: We analyzed and designed the abstract components necessary for a distributed feasibility query. This included a user interface for creating the query, backend with an ontology and terminology service, middleware for query distribution, and FHIR feasibility query execution service. Results: We implemented the components described in the Methods section. The resulting solution was distributed to 33 German university hospitals. The functionality of the comprehensive network infrastructure was demonstrated using a test data set based on the German Corona Consensus Data Set. A performance test using specifically created synthetic data revealed the applicability of our solution to data sets containing millions of FHIR resources. The solution can be easily deployed across hospitals and supports feasibility queries, combining multiple inclusion and exclusion criteria using standard Health Level Seven query languages such as Clinical Quality Language and FHIR Search. Developing a platform based on multiple microservices allowed us to create an extendable platform and support multiple Health Level Seven query languages and middleware components to allow integration with future directions of the Medical Informatics Initiative. Conclusions: We designed and implemented a feasibility platform for distributed feasibility queries, which works directly on FHIR-formatted data and distributed it across 33 university hospitals in Germany. We showed that developing a feasibility platform directly on the FHIR standard is feasible. ©Julian Gruendner, Noemi Deppenwiese, Michael Folz, Thomas Köhler, Björn Kroll, Hans-Ulrich Prokosch, Lorenz Rosenau, Mathias Rühle, Marc-Anton Scheidl, Christina Schüttler, Brita Sedlmayr, Alexander Twrdik, Alexander Kiel, Raphael W Majeed.",consensus data set; COVID-19; CQL; distributed analysis; Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources; feasibility study; federated feasibility queries; FHIR; FHIR Search; health data; HL7 FHIR; medical informatics; pandemic; patient data; query,,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

We evaluated the usability, acceptability, and clinical impact of a store-and-forward teledermatology mobile application (app) linking families with pediatric dermatologists. Methods: Parents of children age 6 weeks to 17 years or individuals 18-21 years old were invited (by e-mail or referral) to participate in this single group, prospective study. Within the app, users photographed the skin condition, answered questions, and submitted their case for review. One pediatric dermatologist viewed cases, diagnosed conditions, and provided instructions and prescriptions. User surveys immediately following app use and 1 week later, supplemented by electronic logs, assessed usability, acceptability, and impact. Results: One hundred ninety-seven parents and one adolescent submitted cases within 39 days of invitation. App users were more likely to be white than those in the population invited (67% vs. 34%, p < 0.001) and their children were slightly younger (mean 7.3 vs. 9.0 years, p < 0.001). A majority, 83% found the app easy to use, 97% felt that submitting a case took ""the right amount of time,"" 87% were satisfied, and 93% would use the app again. Prescription receipt was associated with increased app satisfaction (p = 0.008). The median user received a response in 2.8 h (interquartile range 1.1-6.4). Had the app been unavailable, 44% reported that they would have waited for primary care, 32% for a dermatology appointment, and 7% would have gone to an urgent care clinic.

Pharmacogenomic testing has the potential to improve the safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapy, but clinical application of pharmacogenetic knowledge has remained uncommon. Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems could help overcome some of the barriers to clinical implementation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the perception and usability of a web- and mobile-enabled CDS system for pharmacogenetics-guided drug therapy-the Medication Safety Code (MSC) system-among potential users (i.e., physicians and pharmacists). Furthermore, this study sought to collect data on the practicability and comprehensibility of potential layouts of a proposed personalized pocket card that is intended to not only contain the machine-readable data for use with the MSC system but also humanreadable data on the patient's pharmacogenomic profile. Methods. We deployed an emergent mixed methods design encompassing (1) qualitative interviews with pharmacists and pharmacy students, (2) a survey among pharmacogenomics experts that included both qualitative and quantitative elements and (3) a quantitative survey among physicians and pharmacists. The interviews followed a semistructured guide including a hypothetical patient scenario that had to be solved by using the MSC system. The survey among pharmacogenomics experts focused on what information should be printed on the card and how this information should be arranged. Furthermore, the MSC system was evaluated based on two hypothetical patient scenarios and four follow-up questions on the perceived usability. The second survey assessed physicians' and pharmacists' attitude towards the MSC system. Results. In total, 101 physicians, pharmacists and PGx experts coming from various relevant fields evaluated the MSC system. Overall, the reaction to the MSC system was positive across all investigated parameters and among all user groups. The majority of participants were able to solve the patient scenarios based on the recommendations displayed on the MSC interface. A frequent request among participants was to provide specific listings of alternative drugs and concrete dosage instructions. Negligence of other patient-specific factors for choosing the right treatment such as renal function and co-medication was a common concern related to the MSC system, while data privacy and cost-benefit considerations emerged as the participants' major concerns regarding pharmacogenetic testing in general. The results of the card layout evaluation indicate that a gene-centered and tabulated presentation of the patient's pharmacogenomic profile is helpful and well-accepted. Conclusions. We found that the MSC system was well-received among the physicians and pharmacists included in this study. A personalized pocket card that lists a patient's metabolizer status along with critically affected drugs can alert physicians and pharmacists to the availability of essential therapy modifications. © 2016 Blagec et al.",Clinical; Decision support systems; Individualized medicine; Mixed methods studies; Pharmacogenetics; User studies,adult; aged; Article; computerized provider order entry; decision support system; female; human; male; pharmacist; pharmacogenetics; pharmacogenomics; pharmacy student; prescription; questionnaire; scoring system,PeerJ Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

518,Hawig D.; Zhou C.; Fuhrhop S.; Fialho A.S.; Ramachandran N.,Designing a distributed ledger technology system for interoperable and general data protection regulation–compliant health data exchange: A use case in blood glucose data,2019,Journal of Medical Internet Research,30.0,10.2196/13665,"Background: Distributed ledger technology (DLT) holds great potential to improve health information exchange. However, the immutable and transparent character of this technology may conflict with data privacy regulations and data processing best practices. Objective: The aim of this paper is to develop a proof-of-concept system for immutable, interoperable, and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)–compliant exchange of blood glucose data. Methods: Given that there is no ideal design for a DLT-based patient-provider data exchange solution, we proposed two different variations for our proof-of-concept system. One design was based purely on the public IOTA distributed ledger (a directed acyclic graph-based DLT) and the second used the same public IOTA ledger in combination with a private InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) cluster. Both designs were assessed according to (1) data reversal risk, (2) data linkability risks, (3) processing time, (4) file size compatibility, and (5) overall system complexity. Results: The public IOTA design slightly increased the risk of personal data linkability, had an overall low processing time (requiring mean 6.1, SD 1.9 seconds to upload one blood glucose data sample into the DLT), and was relatively simple to implement. The combination of the public IOTA with a private IPFS cluster minimized both reversal and linkability risks, allowed for the exchange of large files (3 months of blood glucose data were uploaded into the DLT in mean 38.1, SD 13.4 seconds), but involved a relatively higher setup complexity. Conclusions: For the specific use case of blood glucose explored in this study, both designs presented a suitable performance in enabling the interoperable exchange of data between patients and providers. Additionally, both systems were designed considering the latest guidelines on personal data processing, thereby maximizing the alignment with recent GDPR requirements. For future works, these results suggest that the conflict between DLT and data privacy regulations can be addressed if careful considerations are made regarding the use case and the design of the data exchange system. ©David Hawig, Chao Zhou, Sebastian Fuhrhop, Andre S Fialho, Navin Ramachandran.","Blockchain; Blood glucose; Diabetes; Directed acyclic graph; Distributed ledger technology; FHIR; IOTA; IPFS; Masked Authenticated Messaging, MAM; Mobile health",Blood Glucose; Computer Communication Networks; Data Analysis; Health Information Exchange; Humans; Proof of Concept Study; computer network; data analysis; glucose blood level; human; medical information system; metabolism; proof of concept,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

Fifty-two parents enrolled. Following a traditional genetics results informing visit, the study coordinator stratified families by diagnostic result and uninformative result and then randomized families within each group to an intervention arm to receive the GenomeCOMPASS™ report or to the usual care arm to receive a summary letter from the medical geneticist. A letter inviting enrollment included a baseline survey, which once returned, constituted enrollment. Surveys were administered at 3 months post-genetics visit. At 6 months, the usual care arm crossed over to receive the intervention and were administered an additional survey at 3 months. Qualitative interviews were conducted following survey completion to augment the survey data regarding the patient centered outcomes of interest. Patient reported outcomes including communication, engagement, empowerment and satisfaction. In the intervention arm, GenomeCOMPASS™ reports were released to 14 families (N = 28 parents) and of those 21 (75%) returned 3 month surveys. In the usual care arm, 12 families (N = 24 parents) received usual care summary letters and of those 20 (83%) returned 3 month surveys. At crossover, GenomeCOMPASS™ reports were released to 20 individuals and 15 (75%) returned 3 month surveys. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 5 individuals. Use of the GenomeCOMPASS™ report was reported by this small group of parents to improve communication with providers and non-health professionals such as educators and therapists and led to increased engagement and high satisfaction. Providers and others involved in the children’s care also endorsed the report’s effectiveness. Reports that addressed negative findings, i.e. uninformative results, were not found to be useful. Although the number of users was small, this study supports that customizable template reports may provide a useful and durable source of information that can support and enhance the information provided by genetics professionals in traditional face-to-face encounters.

Recent advances in technological innovations and genetics and the growing availability of health data have set a new pace of the research and impose a set of new requirements on the different stakeholders. Some studies are available that discuss about the different aspects of PM. Nevertheless, a holistic representation of those aspects deemed to confer with the technological perspective, in relation to the applications and challenges, have been mostly ignored. In this context, this paper surveys the advances in PM from the informatics viewpoint and reviews the enabling tools and techniques in a categorized manner. In addition, the study discusses how other technological paradigms, which include big data, artificial intelligence, and the internet of things, can be exploited to advance the potentials of PM. Furthermore, the paper provides some guidelines for future research for a seamless implementation and a wide-scale deployment of PM based on the identified open issues and the associated challenges. As a result, the paper proposes an integrated holistic framework for PM motivating informatics researchers to design their relevant research work in an appropriate context. © 2013 IEEE.",artificial intelligence; big data; bioinformatics; clinical decision support; deep learning; informatics; machine learning; Precision medicine; the Internet of Things,Artificial intelligence; Big data; Bioinformatics; Decision support systems; Deep learning; Informatics; Internet of things; Learning systems; Medicine; Personalized medicine; Clinical decision support; Enabling tools; Health data; Holistic frameworks; Medical practice; Paper surveys; Technological innovation; Technological perspective; Medical informatics,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

The KETOS platform demonstrated in this work implements a tool for researchers allowing them to perform statistical analyses and deploy resulting models in a secure environment. Methods The proposed system uses Docker virtualization to provide researchers with reproducible data analysis and development environments, accessible via Jupyter Notebook, to perform statistical analysis and develop, train and deploy models based on standardized input data. The platform is built in a modular fashion and interfaces with web services using the Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard to access patient data. In our prototypical implementation we use an OMOP common data model (OMOP-CDM) database. The architecture supports the entire research lifecycle from creating a data analysis environment, retrieving data, and training to final deployment in a hospital setting. Results We evaluated the platform by establishing and deploying an analysis and end user application for hemoglobin reference intervals within the University Hospital Erlangen. To demonstrate the potential of the system to deploy arbitrary models, we loaded a colorectal cancer dataset into an OMOP database and built machine learning models to predict patient outcomes and made them available via a web service. We demonstrated both the integration with FHIR as well as an example end user application. Finally, we integrated the platform with the open source DataSHIELD architecture to allow for distributed privacy preserving data analysis and training across networks of hospitals. Conclusion The KETOS platform takes a novel approach to data analysis, training and deploying decision support models in a hospital or healthcare setting. It does so in a secure and privacy-preserving manner, combining the flexibility of Docker virtualization with the advantages of standardized vocabularies, a widely applied database schema (OMOP-CDM), and a standardized way to exchange medical data (FHIR). © 2019 Gruendner et al.

Objective: This study outlines how we used mobile apps and semantic web standards such as HTTP 2.0, Representational State Transfer, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), JSON Schema, Transport Layer Security (version 1.3), Advanced Encryption Standard-256, OpenAPI, HTML5, and Vega, in conjunction with patient and provider feedback to completely update a previous version of mindLAMP. Methods: The Learn, Assess, Manage, and Prevent (LAMP) platform addresses the abovementioned challenges in enhancing clinical insight by supporting research, data analysis, and implementation efforts around PGHD as an open-source solution with freely accessible and shared code. Results: With a simplified programming interface and novel data representation that captures additional metadata, the LAMP platform enables interoperability with existing Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources-based health care systems as well as consumer wearables and services such as Apple HealthKit and Google Fit. The companion Cortex data analysis and machine learning toolkit offer robust support for artificial intelligence, behavioral feature extraction, interactive visualizations, and high-performance data processing through parallelization and vectorization techniques. Conclusions: The LAMP platform incorporates feedback from patients and clinicians alongside a standards-based approach to address these needs and functions across a wide range of use cases through its customizable and flexible components. These range from simple survey-based research to international consortiums capturing multimodal data to simple delivery of mindfulness exercises through personalized, just-in-Time adaptive interventions. © 2022 JMIR Publications.

In addition, the U.S. Office of the National Coordinator has recognized the trend toward storing complete sequencing data outside the EHR in a Genomic Archiving and Communication System (GACS) and has emphasized the need for pilots that test Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) Genomics for GACS integration with EHRs. We sought to develop a PGx clinical decision support (CDS) service, leveraging the emerging FHIR and CDS Hooks standards, and based on an assumption that pharmacogene sequencing data would be stored alongside the EHR in a GACS. Methods We developed a PGx CDS service as a functional prototype. The service is triggered by a medication order in the EHR. When evoked, the service looks for relevant genetic data in a GACS and returns corresponding recommendations back to the ordering clinician. Where the patient has no genetic data on file, the service can recommend pretreatment genetic testing where applicable. Results Overall, we were able to meet our objectives and deploy a functional prototype, interfaced with a commercial EHR. We identified several areas where FHIR or CDS Hooks lacked necessary semantics or have implementation ambiguity. Primary FHIR challenges included multiple ways to say the same thing, which exacerbated the complexity of variant to allele conversion and lack of representation of deoxyribonucleic acid region(s) studied. Primary CDS Hooks challenges included the complexity of executing an authenticated query against one system (GACS) upon being triggered by a different system (the EHR), and limitations in the types of actionable recommendations that can be returned to the EHR. Conclusions In conclusion, we have found that PGx CDS based on FHIR and CDS Hooks appears to represent a promising means of genomics-EHR integration. More real-world testing along with a set of use-case driven GACS interface requirements will push us closer to the U.S. National Human Genome Research Institute vision of a plug-in PGx app. © 2018 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.

To quantify transitions of care between acute hospital trusts and health record systems to guide improvements to data sharing and interoperability. Design Retrospective observational study using Hospital Episode Statistics. Setting Acute hospital trusts in the NHS in England. Participants All adult patients resident in England that had one or more inpatient, outpatient or accident and emergency encounters at acute NHS hospital trusts between April 2017 and April 2018. Primary and secondary outcome measures Frequency of use and spatial distribution of health record systems. Frequency and spatial distribution of transitions of care between hospital trusts and health record systems. Results 21 286 873 patients were involved in 121 351 837 encounters at 152 included trusts. 117 (77.0%) hospital trusts were using electronic health records (EHR). There was limited regional alignment of EHR systems. On 11 017 767 (9.1%) occasions, patients attended a hospital using a different health record system to their previous hospital attendance. 15 736 863 (73.9%) patients had two or more encounters with the included trusts and 3 931 255 (25.0%) of those attended two or more trusts. Over half (53.6%) of these patients had encounters shared between just 20 pairs of hospitals. Only two of these pairs of trusts used the same EHR system. Conclusions Each year, millions of patients in England attend two or more different hospital trusts. Most of the pairs of trusts that commonly share patients do not use the same record systems. This research highlights significant barriers to inter-hospital data sharing and interoperability. Findings from this study can be used to improve electronic health record system coordination and develop targeted approaches to improve interoperability. The methods used in this study could be used in other healthcare systems that face the same interoperability challenges. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY.

We offer mitigating strategies to reduce unintended consequences, maximize patient safety, and enhance health care delivery. Methods We searched PubMed and other sources to identify articles describing EHR-to-EHR transitions. We combined these references with the authors' extensive experience to construct a conceptual schema and to offer recommendations to facilitate transitions. Results Our PubMed query retrieved 1,351 citations: 43 were relevant for full paper review and 18 met the inclusion criterion of focus on EHR-to-EHR transitions. An additional PubMed search yielded 1,014 citations, for which we reviewed 74 full papers and included 5. We supplemented with additional citations for a total of 70 cited. We distinguished 10 domains in the literature that overlap yet present unique and salient opportunities for successful transitions and for problem mitigation. Discussion There is scant literature concerning EHR-to-EHR transitions. Identified challenges include financial burdens, personnel resources, patient safety threats from limited access to legacy records, data integrity during migration, cybersecurity, and semantic interoperability. Transition teams must overcome inadequate human infrastructure, technical challenges, security gaps, unrealistic providers' expectations, workflow changes, and insufficient training and support-all factors affecting potential clinician burnout. Conclusion EHR transitions are remarkably expensive, laborious, personnel devouring, and time consuming. The paucity of references in comparison to the topic's salience reinforces the necessity for this type of review and analysis. Prudent planning may streamline EHR transitions and reduce expenses. Mitigating strategies, such as preservation of legacy data, managing expectations, and hiring short-term specialty consultants can overcome some of the greatest hurdles. A new medical subject headings (MeSH) term for EHR transitions would facilitate further research on this topic. © 2020 American Institute of Physics Inc..

We built and designed an online, secure, electronic custom interface termed the Genomic Prescribing System (GPS). Methods Actionable pharmacogenomic (PGx) information was reviewed, collected, and stored in the back-end of GPS to enable creation of customized drug- and variant-specific clinical decision support (CDS) summaries. The database architecture utilized the star schema to store information. Patient raw genomic data underwent transformation via custom-designed algorithms to enable gene and phenotype-level associations. Multiple external data sets (PubMed, The Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED), National Drug File – Reference Terminology (ND-FRT), and a publically-available PGx knowledgebase) were integrated to facilitate the delivery of patient, drug, disease, and genomic information. Institutional security infrastructure was leveraged to securely store patient genomic and clinical data on a HIPAA-compliant server farm. Results As of May 17, 2016, the GPS back-end housed 257 CDS encompassing 112 genetic variants, 42 genes, and 46 PGx-actionable drugs. The GPS user interface presented patient-specific CDS alongside a recognizable traffic light symbol (green/yellow/red), denoting PGx risk for each genomic result. The number of traffic lights per visit increased with the corresponding increase in the number of available PGx-annotated drugs over time. An integrated drug and disease search functionality, links to primary literature sources, and potential alternative PGx drugs were indicated. The system, which was initially used as stand-alone CDS software within our clinical environment, was then integrated with the institutional electronic medical record for enhanced usability. There have been nearly 2000 logins in 43 months since inception, with usage exceeding 56 logins per month and system up-times of 99.99%. For all patient-provider visits encompassing >3 years of implementation, unique alert click-through rates corresponded to genomic risk: red lights clicked 100%, yellow lights 79%, green lights 43%. Conclusions Successful deployment of GPS by combining complex data and recognizable iconography led to a tool that enabled point-of-care genomic delivery with high usability. Continued scalability and incorporation of additional clinical elements to be considered alongside PGx information could expand future impact. © 2017",Clinical decision support; Informatics; Pharmacogenetics; Precision medicine; Systematized nomenclature of medicine,"Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Pharmacogenetics; Precision Medicine; Software; User-Computer Interface; Controlled drug delivery; Decision support systems; Medical computing; Medicine; Metadata; Targeted drug delivery; Terminology; User interfaces; Clinical decision support; Clinical environments; Database architecture; Electronic medical record; Informatics; Pharmacogenetics; Security infrastructure; User friendly interface; Article; clinical decision support system; clinical practice; electronic medical record; gene; genetic variability; genomic prescribing system; genomics; health care planning; human; pharmacogenomics; prescription; priority journal; systematic review; computer interface; electronic health record; personalized medicine; pharmacogenetics; software; Genes",Academic Press Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access

PCplanner screens the EHR for ICU patients meeting any of five prompts (triggers) for palliative care consultation, allows families to report their unmet palliative care needs, and alerts clinicians to these needs. The evaluation phase included a prospective before/after study conducted at a large academic medical center. Two control populations were enrolled in the before period to serve as context for the intervention. First, 25 ICU patients who received palliative care consults served as patient-level controls. Second, 49 family members of ICU patients who received mechanical ventilation for at least 48 hours served as family-level controls. Afterward, 14 patients, 18 family members, and 10 clinicians participated in the intervention evaluation period. Family member outcomes measured at baseline and 4 days later included acceptability (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire [CSQ]), usability (Systems Usability Scale [SUS]), and palliative care needs, assessed with the adapted needs of social nature, existential concerns, symptoms, and therapeutic interaction (NEST) scale; the Patient-Centeredness of Care Scale (PCCS); and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Patient outcomes included frequency of goal concordant treatment, hospital length of stay, and discharge disposition. Results: Family members reported high PC planner acceptability (mean CSQ, 14.1 [SD, 1.4]) and usability (mean SUS, 21.1 [SD, 1.7]). PCplanner family member recipients experienced a 12.7-unit reduction in NEST score compared with a 3.4-unit increase among controls (P = 0.002), as well as improved mean scores on the PCCS (6.6 [SD, 5.8]) and the PSS (20.8 [SD, 1.9]). The frequency of goal concordant treatment increased over the course of the intervention (n = 14 [SD, 79%] vs. n = 18 [SD, 100%]). Compared with palliative care controls, intervention patients received palliative care consultation sooner (3.9 [SD, 2.7] vs. 6.9 [SD, 7.1] mean days), had a shorter mean hospital length of stay (20.5 [SD, 9.1] vs. 22.3 [SD, 16.0] patient number), and received hospice care more frequently (5 [36%] vs. 5 [20%]), although these differences were not statistically significant. Conclusions: PCplanner represents an acceptable, usable, and clinically promising systems-based approach to delivering EHR-triggered, needs-targeted ICU-based palliative care within a standard clinical workflow. A clinical trial in a larger population is needed to evaluate its efficacy.

To fully realize the value, it is critical to place credible information in the hands of clinicians in time to support clinical decision making. The electronic health record is an essential component of clinician workflow. Utilizing the electronic health record to present information to support the use of genomic medicine in clinical care to improve outcomes represents a tremendous opportunity. However, there are numerous barriers that prevent the effective use of the electronic health record for this purpose. The electronic health record working groups of the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network and the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) project, along with other groups, have been defining these barriers, to allow the development of solutions that can be tested using implementation pilots.

It also makes health self-management much more feasible, which can partially mitigate one of the challenges that the current healthcare system is facing. Effective and convenient self-management of health requires the collaborative use of health data and home environment data from different services, devices, and even open data on the Web. Although health data interoperability standards including HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and IoT ontology including Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) have been developed and promoted, it is impossible for all the different categories of services to adopt the same standard in the near future. This study presents a method that applies Semantic Web technologies to integrate the health data and home environment data from heterogeneously built services and devices. We propose a Web Ontology Language (OWL)-based integration ontology that models health data from HL7 FHIR standard implemented services, normal Web services and Web of Things (WoT) services and Linked Data together with home environment data from formal ontology-described WoT services. It works on the resource integration layer of the layered integration architecture. An example use case with a prototype implementation shows that the proposed method successfully integrates the health data and home environment data into a resource graph. The integrated data are annotated with semantics and ontological links, which make them machine-understandable and cross-system reusable. © 2019 by the authors.

Since most electronic health record (EHR) systems do not yet provide such functionality, we developed an EHRagnostic, clinico-genomic mobile app to demonstrate several features that will be needed for point-of-care conversations. Methods: Our prototype, called Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technology (SMART)VR PCM, visualizes genomic information in real time, comparing a patient's diagnosis-specific somatic gene mutations detected by PCR-based hotspot testing to a population-level set of comparable data. The initial prototype works for patient specimens with 0 or 1 detected mutation. Genomics extensions were created for the Health Level SevenVR Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)VR standard; otherwise, the prototype is a normal SMART on FHIR app. Results: The PCM prototype can rapidly present a visualization that compares a patient's somatic genomic alterations against a distribution built from more than 3000 patients, along with context-specific links to external knowledge bases. Initial evaluation by oncologists provided important feedback about the prototype's strengths and weaknesses. We added several requested enhancements and successfully demonstrated the app at the inaugural American Society of Clinical Oncology Interoperability Demonstration; we have also begun to expand visualization capabilities to include cancer specimens with multiple mutations. Discussion: PCM is open-source software for clinicians to present the individual patient within the population-level spectrum of cancer somatic mutations. The app can be implemented on any SMART on FHIR-enabled EHRs, and future versions of PCM should be able to evolve in parallel with external knowledge bases. © The Author 2016.

537,Alamri A.,Ontology middleware for integration of iot healthcare information systems in EHR systems,2018,Computers,40.0,10.3390/computers7040051,"Healthcare sectors have been at the forefront of the adoption and use of IoT technologies for efficient healthcare diagnosis and treatment. Because healthcare IoT sensor technology obtains health-related data from patients, it needs to be integrated with the electronic healthcare records (EHR) system. Most EHR systems have not been designed for integration with IoT technology; they have been designed to be more patient-centric management systems. The use of the IoT in EHR remains a long-term goal. Configuring IoT in EHR can enhance patient healthcare, enabling health providers to monitor their patients outside of the clinic. To assist physicians to access data resources efficiently, a data model that is semantic and flexible is needed to connect EHR data and IoT data that may help to provide true interoperability and integration.

Current trends rely on differentiating the representation of data instances from the definition of clinical information models. The dual model approach, which combines a reference model (RM) and a clinical information model (CIM), sets in practice this software design pattern. The most recent initiative, proposed by HL7, is called Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR). The aim of our study was to investigate the feasibility of applying the FHIR standard to modeling and exposing EHR data of the Georges Pompidou European Hospital (HEGP) integrating biology and the bedside (i2b2) clinical data warehouse (CDW). Results: We implemented a FHIR server over i2b2 to expose EHR data in relation with five FHIR resources: DiagnosisReport, MedicationOrder, Patient, Encounter, and Medication. The architecture of the server combines a Data Access Object design pattern and FHIR resource providers, implemented using the Java HAPI FHIR API. Two types of queries were tested: query type #1 requests the server to display DiagnosticReport resources, for which the diagnosis code is equal to a given ICD-10 code. A total of 80 DiagnosticReport resources, corresponding to 36 patients, were displayed. Query type #2, requests the server to display MedicationOrder, for which the FHIR Medication identification code is equal to a given code expressed in a French coding system. A total of 503 MedicationOrder resources, corresponding to 290 patients, were displayed. Results were validated by manually comparing the results of each request to the results displayed by an ad-hoc SQL query. Conclusion: We showed the feasibility of implementing a Java layer over the i2b2 database model to expose data of the CDW as a set of FHIR resources. An important part of this work was the structural and semantic mapping between the i2b2 model and the FHIR RM. To accomplish this, developers must manually browse the specifications of the FHIR standard. Our source code is freely available and can be adapted for use in other i2b2 sites. © 2017 The Author(s).",Clinical data warehouse; Database management systems; FHIR; i2b2; Semantic interoperability,"Data Warehousing; Database Management Systems; Electronic Health Records; Health Information Interoperability; Health Level Seven; Hospitals, Teaching; Humans; biology; database management system; diagnosis; doctor patient relation; electronic health record; feasibility study; female; human; ICD-10; major clinical study; male; model; data interoperability; data warehouse; database management system; health level 7; organization and management; standards; teaching hospital",BioMed Central Ltd,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

To overcome this challenge, we proposed to use Health Level 7's Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) as a meta-CDM-a single standard to represent clinical data. Objective: In this study, we aimed to create an open-source application termed the Clinical Asset Mapping Program for FHIR (CAMP FHIR) to efficiently transform clinical data to FHIR for supporting source-agnostic CDM-to-FHIR mapping. Methods: Mapping with CAMP FHIR involves (1) mapping each source variable to its corresponding FHIR element and (2) mapping each item in the source data's value sets to the corresponding FHIR value set item for variables with strict value sets. To date, CAMP FHIR has been used to transform 108 variables from the Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside (i2b2) and Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network data models to fields across 7 FHIR resources. It is designed to allow input from any source data model and will support additional FHIR resources in the future. Results: We have used CAMP FHIR to transform data on approximately 23,000 patients with asthma from our institution's i2b2 database. Data quality and integrity were validated against the origin point of the data, our enterprise clinical data warehouse. Conclusions: We believe that CAMP FHIR can serve as an alternative to implementing new CDMs on a project-by-project basis. Moreover, the use of FHIR as a CDM could support rare data sharing opportunities, such as collaborations between academic medical centers and community hospitals. We anticipate adoption and use of CAMP FHIR to foster sharing of clinical data across institutions for downstream applications in translational research. © 2019 JMIR Publications Inc..

Evidence from high-quality CDS studies is needed to enable and support this vision of CDS-facilitated care optimization, but limited guidance is available in the literature for designing and reporting CDS studies. To address this research gap, this article provides recommendations for designing, conducting, and reporting CDS studies to: 1) ensure that EHR data to inform the CDS are available; 2) choose decision rules that are consistent with local care processes; 3) target the right users and workflows; 4) make the CDS easy to access and use; 5) minimize the burden placed on users; 6) incorporate CDS success factors identified in the literature, in particular the automatic provision of CDS as a part of clinician workflow; 7) ensure that the CDS rules are adequately tested; 8) select meaningful evaluation measures; 9) use as rigorous a study design as is feasible; 10) think about how to deploy the CDS beyond the original host organization; 11) report the study in context; 12) help the audience understand why the intervention succeeded or failed; and 13) consider the financial implications.

Early identification of sepsis is important as it allows timely administration of potentially life-saving resuscitation and antimicrobial therapy. We present COMPOSER (COnformal Multidimensional Prediction Of SEpsis Risk), a deep learning model for the early prediction of sepsis, specifically designed to reduce false alarms by detecting unfamiliar patients/situations arising from erroneous data, missingness, distributional shift and data drifts. COMPOSER flags these unfamiliar cases as indeterminate rather than making spurious predictions. Six patient cohorts (515,720 patients) curated from two healthcare systems in the United States across intensive care units (ICU) and emergency departments (ED) were used to train and externally and temporally validate this model. In a sequential prediction setting, COMPOSER achieved a consistently high area under the curve (AUC) (ICU: 0.925–0.953; ED: 0.938–0.945). Out of over 6 million prediction windows roughly 20% and 8% were identified as indeterminate amongst non-septic and septic patients, respectively. COMPOSER provided early warning within a clinically actionable timeframe (ICU: 12.2 [3.2 22.8] and ED: 2.1 [0.8 4.5] hours prior to first antibiotics order) across all six cohorts, thus allowing for identification and prioritization of patients at high risk for sepsis. © 2021, The Author(s).",,Deep learning; Forecasting; Learning systems; Resuscitation; antiinfective agent; Antimicrobial therapy; Early prediction; Emergency departments; Erroneous datum; Falsealarms; Healthcare systems; Learn+; Learning models; Prediction algorithms; Shift-and; adult; antibiotic therapy; area under the curve; Article; artificial intelligence; automation; cohort analysis; deep learning; emergency ward; external validity; health care system; high risk patient; human; intensive care unit; internal validity; learning algorithm; major clinical study; missed diagnosis; sepsis; United States; validation process; Intensive care units,Nature Research,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model and the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) tools could be used as a core element in this initiative for harmonizing the terminologies used as well as facilitating the federation of research analyses across institutions. Objective To realize an OMOP/OHDSI-based pilot implementation within a consortium of eight German university hospitals, evaluate the applicability to support data harmonization and sharing among them, and identify potential enhancement requirements. Methods The vocabularies and terminological mapping required for importing the fact data were prepared, and the process for importing the data from the source files was designed. For eight German university hospitals, a virtual machine preconfigured with the OMOP database and the OHDSI tools as well as the jobs to import the data and conduct the analysis was provided. Last, a federated/distributed query to test the approach was executed. Results While the mapping of ICD-10 German Modification succeeded with a rate of 98.8% of all terms for diagnoses, the procedures could not be mapped and hence an extension to the OMOP standard terminologies had to be made. Overall, the data of 3 million inpatients with approximately 26 million conditions, 21 million procedures, and 23 million observations have been imported. A federated query to identify a cohort of colorectal cancer patients was successfully executed and yielded 16,701 patient cases visualized in a Sunburst plot. Conclusion OMOP/OHDSI is a viable open source solution for data integration in a German research consortium.

They portend the opportunity to bring new therapies to patients sooner, potentially at a lower cost, and to accelerate learning health cycles—through faster data acquisition in clinical research studies. Metrics have proven that time can be saved, workflow and processes streamlined, and data quality increased significantly. Pilot projects and now actual investigational trials used for regulatory submissions have shown that these benefits support the transformation of clinical research by leveraging EHRs for research. Panelists at a recent collaborative focused on bridging clinical research and clinical care offered varying perspectives on how the latest standards and technologies could be leveraged to facilitate data transfer from EHR systems into clinical research databases, as well as the associated improvements in data quality. Panelists also discussed other avenues to leverage EHR in clinical research. Improvements and exciting possibilities notwithstanding, much work remains. Data ownership and access, attention to metadata and structured data for data sharing, and broader adoption of global standards are key areas for collaboration. With the steady increase in adoption of EHRs around the world, this is an excellent time for all stakeholders to work together and create an environment such that EHRs can be used more readily for research. The capacity for research can thus be increased to provide more high-quality information that will contribute to rapid continuous learning health systems from which all patients can benefit. © 2019 The Authors.

However, there are many standards for defining such data, hindering communication between different healthcare providers. Even with adopted standards, patients often need to repeatedly provide their health information when they are taken care of at different locations. This problem hinders the adoption of personal health record (PHR), with the patients' health records under their own control. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to propose an interoperability model for PHR use. The methodology consisted prototyping an application model named OmniPHR, to evaluate the structuring of semantic interoperability and integration of different health standards, using a real database from anonymized patients. We evaluated health data from a hospital database with 38 645 adult patients' medical records processed using different standards, represented by openEHR, HL7 FHIR, and MIMIC-III reference models. OmniPHR demonstrated the feasibility to provide interoperability through a standard ontology and artificial intelligence with natural language processing (NLP). Although the first executions reached a 76.39% F1-score and required retraining of the machine-learning process, the final score was 87.9%, presenting a way to obtain the original data from different standards on a single format. Unlike other models, OmniPHR presents a unified, structural semantic and up-to-date vision of PHR for patients and healthcare providers. The results were promising and demonstrated the possibility of subsidizing the creation of inferences rules about possible patient health problems or preventing future problems. © 2018 IEEE.",Natural Language Processing; Ontology; Personal Health Record; Semantic Interoperability,"Adult; Biological Ontologies; Computer Simulation; Electronic Health Records; Health Information Interoperability; Health Records, Personal; Humans; Natural Language Processing; Semantics; Artificial intelligence; Health care; Interoperability; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Semantics; Application modeling; Electronic health record; Health care providers; Health information technologies; Interoperability modeling; NAtural language processing; Personal health record; Semantic interoperability; adoption; adult; article; artificial intelligence; controlled study; electronic patient record; feasibility study; female; health care personnel; human; machine learning; major clinical study; male; medical service; natural language processing; ontology; semantics; vision; biological ontology; computer simulation; data interoperability; electronic health record; medical record; natural language processing; semantics; Learning systems",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,,Article,Final,

The dashboard has 2 components, designed for (1) clinical decision support during follow-up consultations and (2) outcome assessment on populations of interest. To assess the impact of the clinical decision support component, a pre-post study was conducted considering visit duration, number of screening examinations, and lifestyle interventions. A pilot sample of 700 Italian patients was investigated. Judgments on the outcome assessment component were obtained via focus groups with clinicians and health care managers. Results: The use of the decision support component in clinical activities produced a reduction in visit duration (P≪.01) and an increase in the number of screening exams for complications (P <.01). We also observed a relevant, although nonstatistically significant, increase in the proportion of patients receiving lifestyle interventions (from 69% to 77%). Regarding the outcome assessment component, focus groups highlighted the system's capability of identifying and understanding the characteristics of patient subgroups treated at the center. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that decision support tools based on the integration of multiple-source data and visual and predictive analytics do improve the management of a chronic disease such as type 2 diabetes by enacting a successful implementation of the learning health care system cycle. © The Author(s) 2018.

While validated patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are increasingly used in trials, their adoption in care remains limited and generally separated from the medical record. Further, absence of systematic processes for patient-led data submission excludes valuable data from digital devices that can potentially aid in contextualizing health status. With prior experience in developing apps for the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), we sought to make collecting patient-generated health data (PGHD) a fundamental property of health information technology at scale, and in an interoperable, standards-compliant fashion. We build upon the open SMART on FHIR (Fast Health Interoperability Resources) specification to create SMART Markers—a mobile device software framework encapsulating functionality needed for rapid deployment of both patient- and practitioner-facing PGHD apps. We refactored previously developed PROMIS apps to use SMART Markers for handling PGHD-request creation, on-device administration, and generation of a variety of PGHD types and submission of results to a FHIR server. Validation and conformance tests were performed on the generated output and app-reusability was demonstrated across two demo servers. App developers can import SMART Markers into their existing or new apps to readily leverage an interoperable PGHD capturing functionality out of the box, without having to reinvent the wheel. Our approach enables the creation of health system integrated, context-specific experiences for both patients and practitioners. © 2020, The Author(s).",,Computer programming; Digital devices; Health; Reusability; Data submission; Health data; Health informations; Health status; Health systems; Measurement information; Medical record; Patient-reported outcomes; Property; Systematic process; adult; article; human; information system; medical information; medical record; outcome assessment; patient-reported outcome; physician; software; Interoperability,Nature Research,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

Automated methods for individualized risk prediction have great potential to address this growing public health threat. To facilitate their adoption, they must first be validated across diverse health care settings. Objective: To evaluate the generalizability and cross-site performance of a risk prediction method using readily available structured data from electronic health records in predicting incident suicide attempts across multiple, independent, US health care systems. Design, Setting, and Participants: For this prognostic study, data were extracted from longitudinal electronic health record data comprising International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnoses, laboratory test results, procedures codes, and medications for more than 3.7 million patients from 5 independent health care systems participating in the Accessible Research Commons for Health network. Across sites, 6 to 17 years' worth of data were available, up to 2018. Outcomes were defined by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes reflecting incident suicide attempts (with positive predictive value >0.70 according to expert clinician medical record review). Models were trained using naive Bayes classifiers in each of the 5 systems. Models were cross-validated in independent data sets at each site, and performance metrics were calculated. Data analysis was performed from November 2017 to August 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was suicide attempt as defined by a previously validated case definition using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. The accuracy and timeliness of the prediction were measured at each site. Results: Across the 5 health care systems, of the 3714105 patients (2130454 female [57.2%]) included in the analysis, 39162 cases (1.1%) were identified. Predictive features varied by site but, as expected, the most common predictors reflected mental health conditions (eg, borderline personality disorder, with odds ratios of 8.1-12.9, and bipolar disorder, with odds ratios of 0.9-9.1) and substance use disorders (eg, drug withdrawal syndrome, with odds ratios of 7.0-12.9). Despite variation in geographical location, demographic characteristics, and population health characteristics, model performance was similar across sites, with areas under the curve ranging from 0.71 (95% CI, 0.70-0.72) to 0.76 (95% CI, 0.75-0.77). Across sites, at a specificity of 90%, the models detected a mean of 38% of cases a mean of 2.1 years in advance. Conclusions and Relevance: Across 5 diverse health care systems, a computationally efficient approach leveraging the full spectrum of structured electronic health record data was able to detect the risk of suicidal behavior in unselected patients. This approach could facilitate the development of clinical decision support tools that inform risk reduction interventions. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

Methods We created a custom SMART on FHIR-compatible server infrastructure written in Node.js that served two primary functions. First, it handled API management activities such rate-limiting, authorization, auditing, logging, and analytics. Second, it retrieved the EHR data and made it available in a FHIR-compatible format. Finally, we made required changes to the EHR user interface to allow us to integrate several compatible apps into the provider- and patient-facing EHR workflows. Results After integrating SMART on FHIR into our Epic-based EHR, we demonstrated several types of apps running on the infrastructure. This included both provider- and patient-facing apps as well as apps that are closed source, open source and internally-developed. We integrated the apps into the testing environment of our desktop EHR as well as our patient portal. We also demonstrated the integration of a native iOS app. Conclusion In this paper, we demonstrate the successful implementation of the SMART and FHIR technologies on our Epic-based EHR and subsequent integration of several compatible provider- and patient-facing apps. © 2016",Electronic health records; HL7 FHIR; Interoperability; Software,Boston; Electronic Health Records; Health Information Exchange; Health Level Seven; Humans; Mobile Applications; Software; Systems Integration; Computer software; Facings; Interoperability; Open source software; Records management; User interfaces; Electronic health record; Healthcare Interoperability; HL7 FHIR; Management activities; Primary functions; Reusable technology; Server infrastructure; Testing environment; Article; controlled study; electronic medical record system; growth curve; health care utilization; human; meaningful use criteria; medical information; medical information system; mobile application; priority journal; electronic health record; health level 7; Massachusetts; organization and management; software; standards; system analysis; Health,Elsevier Ireland Ltd,,,,Article,Final,

Constructing a trajectory for the UAV to traverse all SNs with the cheapest cost is an important issue in UAV-aided WRSN. Although some exact algorithms and heuristic methods have been proposed, they cannot achieve a superb result for the large-scale scene within the tolerable time. In this paper, we study the UAV's trajectory optimization problem from a novel viewpoint that the designed trajectory should maximize the UAV's energy utilization efficiency. The maximum UAV's energy utilization efficiency problem is decomposed as integer programming and non-convex optimization problems. For the problem that UAV's charging position is fixed, we have speeded the algorithm's performance by limiting the search direction, the initial search position, and the search space. In the other case, where the power transfer efficiency is unchangeable within a certain distance, a polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme (PRAS) is presented to find the approximate minimum number of hovering locations. We have presented TPA-FCP and TPA-ERC to solve the above problems, respectively. The numerical results verify that our proposed algorithms effectively reduce the length of optimal trajectory and the time complexity. Besides, the energy carried by the UAV for the specified task is predictable, which provides valuable information for arranging the UAV's flight task. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",enery efficiency; trajectory optimization problem; Unmanned aerial vehicle; wireless rechargeable network,Aerodynamics; Antennas; Convex optimization; Energy transfer; Energy utilization; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Integer programming; Polynomial approximation; Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Trajectories; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Algorithm's performance; Energy utilization efficiency; Nonconvex optimization; Power transfer efficiency; Randomized approximation schemes; Rechargeable sensor networks; Rechargeable sensors; Trajectory optimization; Wireless charging,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,,Article,Final,

The technological development of communication networks, including the Internet, sensor networks, and M2M (Machine-to-Machine) have given rise to new architectures, applications, and standards related to addressing almost all current e-health challenges. Among the standards, the importance of OpenEHR has been recognized, since it enables the separation of medical semantics from data representation of electronic health records. However, it does not meet the requirements related to interoperability of e-health devices in M2M networks, or in the Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. Moreover, the lack of interoperability hampers the application of new data-processing techniques, such as data mining and online analytical processing, due to the heterogeneity of the data and the sources. This article proposes an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) platform for pervasive healthcare that ensures interoperability, quality of the detection process, and scalability in an M2M-based architecture, and provides functionalities for the processing of high volumes of data, knowledge extraction, and common healthcare services. The platform uses the semantics described in OpenEHR for both data quality evaluation and standardization of healthcare data stored by the association of IoMT devices and observations defined in OpenEHR. Moreover, it enables the application of big data techniques and online analytic processing (OLAP) through Hadoop Map/Reduce and content-sharing through fast healthcare interoperability resource (FHIR) application programming interfaces (APIs). © 2019 by the authors.

The diffusion of digital tools has led to a significant growth of patient generated health data (PGHD), defined as health-related data created, gathered or inferred by or from patients and for which the patient controls data collection and data sharing. Purpose: We assessed the current evidence of the impact of PGHD use in clinical practice and provide recommendations for the formal integration of PGHD in clinical care. Methods: We searched PubMed, Ovid, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus up to May 2018. Inclusion criteria were applied and four reviewers screened titles and abstracts and consequently full articles. Findings: Our systematic literature review identified 21 studies that examined the use of PGHD in clinical settings. Integration of PGHD into electronic records was extremely limited, and decision support capabilities were for the most part basic. Discussion: PGHD and other types of patient-reported data will be part of the health care system narrative and we must continue efforts to understand its impact on health outcomes, costs, and patient satisfaction.

Methods A specification for the basis of a clinic-genomic standard, building upon the current Health Level Seven International Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR®) standard, was developed. An FHIR application protocol interface (API) layer was attached to proprietary sequencing platforms and EHRs in order to expose gene variant data for presentation to the end-user. Three representative apps based on the SMART platform were built to test end-to-end feasibility, including integration of genomic and clinical data. Results Successful design, deployment, and use of the API was demonstrated and adopted by HL7 Clinical Genomics Workgroup. Feasibility was shown through development of three apps by various types of users with background levels and locations.

Interventions that used one-on-one patient training were associated with the highest portal use. Patients with limited health or digital literacy faced challenges to portal use. Clinicians reported a lack of workflows to support patient use of portals in routine practice. These studies suggest that achieving higher rates of patient engagement through EHR portals will require paying more attention to the needs of diverse patients and systematically measuring usability as well as scope of content. Future work should incorporate implementation science approaches and directly address the key role of clinicians and staff in promoting portal use. © 2020 American College of Physicians.

559,Hylock R.H.; Zeng X.,A blockchain framework for patient-centered health records and exchange (healthChain): Evaluation and proof-of-concept study,2019,Journal of Medical Internet Research,105.0,10.2196/13592,"Background: Blockchain has the potential to disrupt the current modes of patient data access, accumulation, contribution, exchange, and control. Using interoperability standards, smart contracts, and cryptographic identities, patients can securely exchange data with providers and regulate access. The resulting comprehensive, longitudinal medical records can significantly improve the cost and quality of patient care for individuals and populations alike. Objective: This work presents HealthChain, a novel patient-centered blockchain framework. The intent is to bolster patient engagement, data curation, and regulated dissemination of accumulated information in a secure, interoperable environment. A mixed-block blockchain is proposed to support immutable logging and redactable patient blocks. Patient data are generated and exchanged through Health Level-7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, allowing seamless transfer with compliant systems. In addition, patients receive cryptographic identities in the form of public and private key pairs. Public keys are stored in the blockchain and are suitable for securing and verifying transactions. Furthermore, the envisaged system uses proxy re-encryption (PRE) to share information through revocable, smart contracts, ensuring the preservation of privacy and confidentiality. Finally, several PRE improvements are offered to enhance performance and security. Methods: The framework was formulated to address key barriers to blockchain adoption in health care, namely, information security, interoperability, data integrity, identity validation, and scalability. It supports 16 configurations through the manipulation of 4 modes. An open-source, proof-of-concept tool was developed to evaluate the performance of the novel patient block components and system configurations. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework and evaluate resource consumption, extensive testing was performed on each of the 16 configurations over a variety of scenarios involving a variable number of existing and imported records. Results: The results indicate several clear high-performing, low-bandwidth configurations, although they are not the strongest cryptographically. Of the strongest models, one's anticipated cumulative record size is shown to influence the selection. Although the most efficient algorithm is ultimately user specific, Advanced Encryption Standard-encrypted data with static keys, incremental server storage, and no additional server-side encryption are the fastest and least bandwidth intensive, whereas proxy re-encrypted data with dynamic keys, incremental server storage, and additional server-side encryption are the best performing of the strongest configurations. Conclusions: Blockchain is a potent and viable technology for patient-centered access to and exchange of health information. By integrating a structured, interoperable design with patient-accumulated and generated data shared through smart contracts into a universally accessible blockchain, HealthChain presents patients and providers with access to consistent and comprehensive medical records. Challenges addressed include data security, interoperability, block storage, and patient-administered data access, with several configurations emerging for further consideration regarding speed and security. © Ray Hales Hylock, Xiaoming Zeng.

It is hard, however, to obtain a unified view of health data that is distributed across different health providers. In particular, health records are commonly scattered in multiple places and are not integrated. Objective: This article presents the implementation and evaluation of a PHR model that integrates distributed health records using blockchain technology and the openEHR interoperability standard. We thus follow OmniPHR architecture model, which describes an infrastructure that supports the implementation of a distributed and interoperable PHR. Methods: Our method involves implementing a prototype and then evaluating the integration and performance of medical records from different production databases. In addition to evaluating the unified view of records, our evaluation criteria also focused on non-functional performance requirements, such as response time, CPU usage, memory occupation, disk, and network usage. Results: We evaluated our model implementation using the data set of more than 40 thousand adult patients anonymized from two hospital databases. We tested the distribution and reintegration of the data to compose a single view of health records. Moreover, we profiled the model by evaluating a scenario with 10 superpeers and thousands of competing sessions transacting operations on health records simultaneously, resulting in an average response time below 500 ms. The blockchain implemented in our prototype achieved 98% availability. Conclusion: Our performance results indicated that data distributed via a blockchain could be recovered with low average response time and high availability in the scenarios we tested. Our study also demonstrated how OmniPHR model implementation can integrate distributed data into a unified view of health records. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Blockchain; Distributed systems; Personal Health Record (PHR); Software architecture,"Algorithms; Blockchain; Electronic Health Records; Health Records, Personal; Humans; Software; Blockchain; Health; Network architecture; Software architecture; Architecture modeling; Distributed systems; Electronic health record; Evaluation criteria; Health professionals; High availability; Model implementation; Personal health record; adult; article; averaging; electronic patient record; female; human; major clinical study; male; memory; occupation; reaction time; software; algorithm; electronic health record; medical record; Electronic document exchange",Academic Press Inc.,,,,Article,Final,

Results: This self-triage and self-scheduling tool was designed and implemented in under 2 weeks. During the first 16 days of use, it was completed 1129 times by 950 unique patients. Of completed sessions, 315 (28%) were by asymptomatic patients, and 814 (72%) were by symptomatic patients. Symptomatic patient triage dispositions were as follows: 193 emergent (24%), 193 urgent (24%), 99 nonurgent (12%), 329 self-care (40%). Sensitivity for detecting emergency-level care was 87.5% (95% CI 61.7-98.5%). Discussion: This self-triage and self-scheduling tool has been widely used by patients and is being rapidly expanded to other populations and health systems. The tool has recommended emergency-level care with high sensitivity, and decreased triage time for patients with less severe illness. The data suggests it also prevents unnecessary triage messages, phone calls, and in-person visits. Conclusion: Patient self-triage tools integrated into electronic health record systems have the potential to greatly improve triage efficiency and prevent unnecessary visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

However, it is still a challenge to have a unified viewpoint of patients’ health history, because typically health data is scattered among different health organizations. Furthermore, there are several standards for these records, some of them open and others proprietary. Usually health records are stored in databases within health organizations and rarely have external access. This situation applies mainly to cases where patients’ data are maintained by healthcare providers, known as EHRs (Electronic Health Records). In case of PHRs (Personal Health Records), in which patients by definition can manage their health records, they usually have no control over their data stored in healthcare providers’ databases. Thereby, we envision two main challenges regarding PHR context: first, how patients could have a unified view of their scattered health records, and second, how healthcare providers can access up-to-date data regarding their patients, even though changes occurred elsewhere. For addressing these issues, this work proposes a model named OmniPHR, a distributed model to integrate PHRs, for patients and healthcare providers use. The scientific contribution is to propose an architecture model to support a distributed PHR, where patients can maintain their health history in an unified viewpoint, from any device anywhere. Likewise, for healthcare providers, the possibility of having their patients data interconnected among health organizations. The evaluation demonstrates the feasibility of the model in maintaining health records distributed in an architecture model that promotes a unified view of PHR with elasticity and scalability of the solution. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Blockchain; eHealth; Interoperability; mHealth; Personal health record; PHR,"Communication; Computer Systems; Electronic Health Records; Health Personnel; Health Records, Personal; Humans; Digital storage; Health care; Interoperability; mHealth; Societies and institutions; Architecture modeling; Block-chain; Distributed architecture; Ehealth; Electronic health record; Information and communications technology; Personal health record; Scientific contributions; access to information; Article; computer security; electronic health record; feasibility study; health care organization; human; medical history; medical informatics; medical information system; priority journal; telehealth; computer system; health care personnel; interpersonal communication; medical record; Health",Academic Press Inc.,,,,Article,Final,

This research field inspects the measures and models involved in decision-making and seeks solutions to explain them explicitly. Many of the machine learning algorithms cannot manifest how and why a decision has been cast. This is particularly true of the most popular deep neural network approaches currently in use. Consequently, our confidence in AI systems can be hindered by the lack of explainability in these black-box models. The XAI becomes more and more crucial for deep learning powered applications, especially for medical and healthcare studies, although in general these deep neural networks can return an arresting dividend in performance. The insufficient explainability and transparency in most existing AI systems can be one of the major reasons that successful implementation and integration of AI tools into routine clinical practice are uncommon. In this study, we first surveyed the current progress of XAI and in particular its advances in healthcare applications. We then introduced our solutions for XAI leveraging multi-modal and multi-centre data fusion, and subsequently validated in two showcases following real clinical scenarios. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses can prove the efficacy of our proposed XAI solutions, from which we can envisage successful applications in a broader range of clinical questions. © 2021 The Authors",Explainable AI; Information fusion; Medical image analysis; Multi-domain information fusion; Weakly supervised learning,Decision making; Health care; Image fusion; Information fusion; Learning algorithms; Medical imaging; AI systems; Black boxes; Domain informations; Explainable AI; Medical image analysis; Multi-domain information fusion; Multi-domains; Multi-modal; Research topics; Weakly supervised learning; Deep neural networks,Elsevier B.V.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access

It refers to the ability to clone a physical object (PO) into a software counterpart. The softwarized object, termed logical object, reflects all the important properties and characteristics of the original object within a specific application context. To fully determine the expected properties of the DT, this article surveys the state-of-the-art starting from the original definition within the manufacturing industry. It takes into account related proposals emerging in other fields, namely augmented and virtual reality (e.g., avatars), multiagent systems, and virtualization. This survey thereby allows for the identification of an extensive set of DT features that point to the 'softwarization' of POs. To properly consolidate a shared DT definition, a set of foundational properties is identified and proposed as a common ground outlining the essential characteristics (must-haves) of a DT. Once the DT definition has been consolidated, its technical and business value is discussed in terms of applicability and opportunities. Four application scenarios illustrate how the DT concept can be used and how some industries are applying it. The scenarios also lead to a generic DT architectural model. This analysis is then complemented by the identification of software architecture models and guidelines in order to present a general functional framework for the DT. This article, eventually, analyses a set of possible evolution paths for the DT considering its possible usage as a major enabler for the softwarization process. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",Artificial intelligence (AI); business models; cyber physical systems (CPSs); digital twin (DT); Internet of Things (IoT); machine learning (ML); multiagent systems; network function virtualization; sensors; servitization; smart city; software architecture; softwarization; virtual and augmented reality,Internet of things; Multi agent systems; Surveys; Application contexts; Application scenario; Architectural modeling; Architectural models; Augmented and virtual realities; Essential characteristic; Manufacturing industries; Software architecture model; Digital twin,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access

The project was called Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technologies (SMART).Methods We adopted contemporary web standards for application programming interface transport, authorization, and user interface, and standard medical terminologies for coded data. In our initial design, we created our own openly licensed clinical data models to enforce consistency and simplicity. During the second half of 2013, we updated SMART to take advantage of the clinical data models and the application-programming interface described in a new, openly licensed Health Level Seven draft standard called Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR). Signaling our adoption of the emerging FHIR standard, we called the new platform SMART on FHIR.Results We introduced the SMART on FHIR platform with a demonstration that included several commercial healthcare IT vendors and app developers showcasing prototypes at the Health Information Management Systems Society conference in February 2014. This established the feasibility of SMART on FHIR, while highlighting the need for commonly accepted pragmatic constraints on the base FHIR specification.Conclusion In this paper, we describe the creation of SMART on FHIR, relate the experience of the vendors and developers who built SMART on FHIR prototypes, and discuss some challenges in going from early industry prototyping to industry-wide production use. © The Author 2016.

Constructing predictive statistical models typically requires extraction of curated predictor variables from normalized EHR data, a labor-intensive process that discards the vast majority of information in each patient’s record. We propose a representation of patients’ entire raw EHR records based on the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) format. We demonstrate that deep learning methods using this representation are capable of accurately predicting multiple medical events from multiple centers without site-specific data harmonization. We validated our approach using de-identified EHR data from two US academic medical centers with 216,221 adult patients hospitalized for at least 24 h. In the sequential format we propose, this volume of EHR data unrolled into a total of 46,864,534,945 data points, including clinical notes. Deep learning models achieved high accuracy for tasks such as predicting: in-hospital mortality (area under the receiver operator curve [AUROC] across sites 0.93–0.94), 30-day unplanned readmission (AUROC 0.75–0.76), prolonged length of stay (AUROC 0.85–0.86), and all of a patient’s final discharge diagnoses (frequency-weighted AUROC 0.90). These models outperformed traditional, clinically-used predictive models in all cases. We believe that this approach can be used to create accurate and scalable predictions for a variety of clinical scenarios. In a case study of a particular prediction, we demonstrate that neural networks can be used to identify relevant information from the patient’s chart. © 2018, The Author(s).",,Deep learning; Diagnosis; Digital storage; E-learning; eHealth; Hospitals; Records management; Electronic health; Health records; Healthcare Interoperability; Healthcare quality; Labor intensive process; Personalized medicines; Predictive models; Predictor variables; Receiver operator curves; Statistic modeling; adult; article; body weight; controlled study; diagnosis; electronic health record; female; hospital mortality; hospital readmission; human; learning; length of stay; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; prediction; university hospital; Forecasting,Nature Publishing Group,,,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

However, fusion imaging presents new technical challenges stemming from the fact that existing information exchange architectures may not support the collection and processing of data that is produced at different times and in different locations. There is a need for new information exchange architectures that address the unique demands of fusion imaging, and that can facilitate the use of fusion imaging processes to improve health outcomes. Using fusion prostate biopsy as a use case, this paper proposes a reference information exchange architecture to support the collection, processing, and dissemination of imaging data. It also briefly discusses a novel imaging product produced using a simple implementation of the architecture.

Administrators of hospital business data report ED performance measures in a weekly static feedback report to clinical and executive staff due to current legacy systems and manual resource allocation processes. The remit of the project was to prototype a system that could integrate data sources from the current QlikSense Dashboard into an interoperable mobile app with the future intention of direct impact on clinical care decision making for the emergency department. A series of meetings between business analytics unit and clinical staff were used to inform a set of requirements for information workflow systems integration to be used on the project. Stimulated patient data that matched typical data feeds from the system was used to develop a prototype interoperable HL7 messaging mobile app that would report waiting patients in their triage categories in near real time. This working protype with synthetic scenarios and data will inform a future deployable production system with information for the patient journey from the ED waiting room into available hospital beds. As most applications are either designed for business analytics or clinical workflows, integrating information data sources into one mobile application that could meet the needs of both clinical and business performance was novel and integral.

We investigate this field by designing a neural network architecture, named AttentionHCare, that innovates by putting together the latest methods for patient trajectory prediction (longitudinal prediction); that is, given a history of hospital admissions, what is the most probable clinical event to take place next? Answering that question might ease the work of healthcare professionals, who must deal with massive amounts of data when working on preventive prognosis. We proposed an architecture composed of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), attention mechanisms, and an encoder-decoder scheme in a single ensemble. Over datasets MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV-ED, our experiments demonstrated results that surpassed baselines and state-of-the-art proposals.

This work aims to build a technological forecast for Health 4.0 in the case of the health system of Guanajuato, one of the Mexican entities with the largest population, economic, and industrial growth rates. A qualitative research approach was used to perform a scientometrics analysis using as inputs selected academic articles and official healthcare reports. This analysis was complemented with information collected through semi-structured interviews and participatory techniques with technology experts, and visits to the largest unit of the Mexican Institute of Social Security of the entity. The technological forecast showed that Health 4.0 represents a solution to some critical issues of Guanajuato's health system. Nevertheless, Health 4.0 conveys a major social challenge because of medical personnel's and patients' low technology proficiency and their resistance to adopt novel technological applications, and the poor coordination of health organizations. © 2022 PICMET.",,Budget control; Health care; Human resource management; Dynamics capability; Economic growths; Health organizations; Health systems; Human dynamics; Large population; Population growth; Potential adoption; Resource capabilities; Surveillance systems; Population statistics,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2022 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology, PICMET 2022",7 August 2022 through 11 August 2022,Portland,Conference paper,Final,

As the emergence of FHIR-based health systems continues to grow, assessing the reliability of such FHIR systems is essential. To the best of our knowledge, no literary work addresses this gap. In this study, for the first time, we explore the trustworthiness of FHIR-based healthcare systems by identifying several relevant fault models and introducing two metrics that can help measure the reliability of FHIR-based systems.

A distributed healthcare system based on the Internet of Things (IoT) connects different medical resources through the use of distributed databases and distributed DBMSs. This enables the provision of intelligent, reliable, and effective healthcare services to patients with chronic illnesses and the elderly. Such systems are called IoT-based distributed healthcare systems (IoT-DHS). The massive amount of heterogeneous data generated becomes cumbersome in processing and analyzing due to variations in data formats. Also, such systems are gradually moving from traditional ETL technique to real-time processing. Hence there is need for efficient handling of such heterogeneous data in real time IoT-DHS. This can be solved by technique called data harmonization (DH) which unifies the representation of such heterogeneous data from IoT-DHS before using IoT-DHS data for further analysis to take decisions. The main emphasis of this paper is to survey state-of-the-art works in Data Harmonization used for IoT-DHSs and a taxonomy is derived based on these systems considering various aspects such as location of processing, data storage management, and input/output data formats.

The data integration centers (DIC) at university medical centers in Germany provide patient data via FHIR® in compliance with the MII core data set (CDS). Requirements for data protection and other legal bases for processing prefer decentralized processing of the relevant data in the DICs and the subsequent exchange of aggregated results for cross-site evaluation. Methods: Requirements from clinical experts were obtained in the context of the MII use case INTERPOLAR. A software architecture was then developed, modeled using 3LGM2, finally implemented and published in a github repository. Results: With the CDS tool chain, we have created software components for decentralized processing on the basis of the MII CDS. The CDS tool chain requires access to a local FHIR endpoint and then transfers the data to an SQL database. This is accessed by the DataProcessor component, which performs calculations with the help of rules (input repo) and writes the results back to the database. The CDS tool chain also has a frontend module (REDCap), which is used to display the output data and calculated results, and allows verification, evaluation, comments and other responses. This feedback is also persisted in the database and is available for further use, analysis or data sharing in the future. Discussion: Other solutions are conceivable. Our solution utilizes the advantages of an SQL database. This enables flexible and direct processing of the stored data using established analysis methods. Due to the modularization, adjustments can be made so that it can be used in other projects. We are planning further developments to support pseudonymization and data sharing. Initial experience is being gathered.

It is only the use of semantic technologies that can act as a guard for data integration and enriching it by adding proper semantics. The Semantic Web gives us a sensible and versatile answer to perceive proficiency across the congregation of healthcare data. Eventually the ultimate goal of improving the health care practices depends on how the healthcare data is linked together. The major challenges to chase the goal are not only limited to enable the integration of heterogeneous data sources but also requires the development of certain tools for efficient search, ontology management, and data analytics.

FHIR reformulated the HL7 XML standard by defining 135+ resources that conceptualize the different aspects of healthcare data such as patients, practitioners, organizations, services, appointments, encounters, diagnostic data, and medications. Developers of healthcare applications select a subset of the resources that are required to solve their problems. However, the standard provides no way to effectively organize a subset of resources into a higher-level construct similar to software design patterns. This paper leverages the design pattern concept to extend the FHIR standard by defining meta resources that are a conceptual construct that clearly defines the involved resources and their interactions into one unified artifact. To illustrate the concepts of this paper, we use a mobile health application for medication reconciliation that integrates information from multiple electronic health records. We leverage FHIR extension mechanisms such as profiles and Bundle resources to integrate the meta resource into the resource contextualization layer of the FHIR standard.

For this reason, a new concept for an interdisciplinary complex practical course was developed for the master's program in computer science at a German university, based on online learning nuggets and a hackathon on site. The core of the concept is a real-world medical application task: extracting ECG patient data from a smartwatch to support primary care physicians in making decisions regarding an action. The concept was developed based on the so-called constructive alignment concept. An initial application of the concept showed that it was rated as very positive in terms of learning experience and working atmosphere.  © 2022 European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI) and IOS Press.",blended learning; constructive alignment; interdisciplinarity; medical informatics,"Decision Making; Education, Distance; Humans; Interdisciplinary Studies; Learning; Wearable Electronic Devices; Data visualization; Electrocardiograms; Hospital data processing; Medical informatics; Wearable technology; AI applications; Blended learning; Constructive alignments; Digital applications; Interdisciplinarity; Is-enabled; Master programs; Medical informatics; Medical professionals; Online learning; decision making; education; electronic device; human; interdisciplinary education; learning; Medical applications",IOS Press BV,"2022 European Federation for Medical Informatics Special Topic Conference: Digital Professionalism in Health and Care: Developing the Workforce, Building the Future, STC 2022",7 September 2022 through 8 September 2022,Cardiff,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access

The KidneyCloud project aims to inform a transplant-specific digital solution by exploring patient pathways and data journeys. This paper reports on the early prototyping of the KidneyCloud clinician interface using an iterative codesign methodology. User workshops identified that for making clinical decisions and adding patients to the national waiting list transplant teams relied heavily on manual processes to access data across systems and organisations. Based on the requirements gathered, a prototype interface was designed to provide a unified view on the available patient data, which aligned with clinical workflows. Interactive prototype screens allowed users to gain hands-on experience and provide rich real-time feedback. This informed the necessary functionalities of the interface, but also helped us understand the capabilities required of the back-end solution. © 2022 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) and IOS Press.",Health Information Interoperability; Organ Transplantation; User-Centered Design,Delivery of Health Care; Feedback; Humans; Kidney; Kidney Transplantation; Workflow; Hospital data processing; Information management; Interoperability; Iterative methods; Medical informatics; Clinical decision; Co-design methodology; Digital solutions; Early prototyping; Health information interoperability; Health informations; Information interoperability; IT system; Kidney transplantation; User workshops; adult; conference paper; data interoperability; hospital admission; human; human tissue; kidney; organ transplantation; organization; patient coding; user-centered design; workflow; feedback system; health care delivery; kidney; kidney transplantation; User centered design,IOS Press BV,"18th World Congress on Medical and Health Informatics: One World, One Health - Global Partnership for Digital Innovation, MEDINFO 2021",2 October 2021 through 4 October 2021,"Virtual, Online",Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access

One of the major OUD challenges faced by the medical community is patient recovery. Current available mobile interventions are very limited in scope and functionality, and do not provide continuity of care (CC) needed for sustained OUD recovery. To address this, we present a mobile intervention, termed Smart Continuity of Care for Opioid Recovery (SCCORe). It is a personalized composite intervention that closely connects OUD recovery patients with healthcare professionals and other caregivers. It also addresses the educational, monitoring, treatment and support needs for success in recovery, with induced engagement as needed. In this paper, we provide the design and operation of SCCORe and evaluate the performance of key functions using a Markov chain. Our results show that SCCORe leads to significant improvement in opioid related quality of life, while reducing the need for healthcare resources. The proposed mobile intervention can be extended to other OUD states such as pain and consumption. This work will lead to clinical evaluation of the intervention to develop digital therapeutics for OUD.  © 2022 IEEE.",continuity of care; Markov Chain; mobile health apps; Mobile intervention; Opioid Use Disorder,Markov processes; mHealth; Patient rehabilitation; Patient treatment; 'current; Community IS; Continuity of cares; Educational monitoring; Health care professionals; Medical community; Mobile health app; Mobile intervention; Opioid use disorder; Opioids; Recovery,IEEE Computer Society,"21st Annual Wireless Telecommunications Symposium, WTS 2022",6 April 2022 through 8 April 2022,"Virtual, Online",Conference paper,Final,

Besides basic information exchange, there is a growing need for Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to support the use of the collected health data in an individual, case-specific work-flow-based manner. This paper presents the results on how workflows can be used to process data from electronic health records, following a semantic web service approach that enables automatic discovery, composition and invocation of suitable web services. Based on this solution, the user (physician) can define its needs from a domain-specific perspective, whereas the ICT-system fulfills those needs with modular web services.

FHIR enables data interoperability as it is based on lightweight open source RESTful services. Many developed countries which already running electronic health record systems are now focused on the adoption of FHIR to unlock its potential benefits by integrating other technologies like Substitutable Medical Applications, Reusable Technology (SMART) platform. In most of the developing countries electronic health record system does not exist because they lag in resources to invest in electronic health record systems and they are still operating on paper-based health record system, so they are unable to adopt FHIR and other related technologies like SMART. Due to which, interoperability is not enabled on this paper-based data. These countries remain at a distance from the benefits of FHIR and SMART platform to provide better patient care to their patients, quick and efficient clinical decision making and better diagnostics. This paper presents the implementation of SMART on FHIR in healthcare organizations of developing countries through a proposed framework SFPBRF which not only maps paper-based health record system's data to HL7's FHIR standard but also integrate the complete SMART on FHIR platform to run SMART apps on this FHIR conformed data. This paper presents successful translation (done by translation engine) of paper-based data to HL7 FHIR standard. It also shows the running of open source and internally developed SMART apps on this FHIR conformed data. Thus, by the successful mapping and implementation of SMART on FHIR through proposed framework SFPBRF we can conclude that FHIR can be adopted in healthcare organizations of developing countries and SMART on FHIR can help a lot in achieving better patient care, quick and efficient decision making and better diagnostics in developing countries. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Developing countries; FHIR; Healthcare; HL7; Paper-based health records; SMART,Bioinformatics; Decision making; Developing countries; Diagnosis; Health care; Medical applications; Records management; Clinical decision making; Electronic health record systems; FHIR; Health records; Healthcare Interoperability; Healthcare organizations; International organizations; SMART; Interoperability,Association for Computing Machinery,"5th International Conference on Biomedical and Bioinformatics Engineering, ICBBE 2018",12 November 2018 through 14 November 2018,Okinawa,Conference paper,Final,

Data is segregated among different platforms, impacting consumers, service providers, research institutes and public health bodies. Our aim is to facilitate the transfer of information between individuals and organisations that hold or require their lifestyle data. We demonstrate that an open source platform based on a clinically recognised interoperability standard - Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) - can meet both consumers and industry needs. We use as an example the case of people managing arthritis. Our contributions are: (i) an extension of the FHIR standard for lifestyle data, (ii) a reference architecture for a Personal Lifestyle Record, (iii) integration with voice-enabled digital assistants for lifestyle data capture and (iv) an open source implementation of this architecture that retrieves, saves and analyses lifestyle data from wearable devices.

There have been several interventions, including those based on health-IT, proposed recently. There is a major need to study these interventions. We are interested in exploring how different IT-based interventions impact opioid related Quality of Life. We developed a model using Markov chain for three different states in OUD. The model and results can lead to better decision making by healthcare professionals, patients and insurance companies. More specifically, the proposed model and results can help in (a) whether to prescribe opioids to different types of patients, (b) what IT-based interventions are suitable with an opioid prescription, and (c) how patients and healthcare professionals can select an intervention out of multiple available interventions. © 2020 26th Americas Conference on Information Systems, AMCIS 2020.

It is a key prerequisite to many clinical analytics applications, yet much of the research to date focuses on assessing data quality of electronic health records for secondary use. This paper proposes a trust model and provenance-based assessment method for considering data quality during clinical decision making at the point of care. The method uses fuzzy logic to infer data quality trust from a data user's trust preferences with respect to data producers, data production methods, verification of data items, and certification of data production methods. Implementation with an existing 'SMART on FHIR' app in primary care demonstrates the feasibility of model and method. An extension to FHIR resources for data quality trust allows for platform interoperability across system contexts. We consider dual process theories in designing a user interface that supports data quality trust for clinical decisions in heuristic and systematic cognitive processing modes. Model and method are adaptable to other application domains that rely on data quality for decision making.  © 2021 IEEE.",clinical decision support; data quality assessment; electronic health records; fuzzy inference; SMART on FHIR; trust models; user interface design,Clinical research; Decision making; Electronic assessment; Fuzzy logic; Health care; Interoperability; Security of data; Software engineering; User interfaces; Clinical decision; Clinical decision making; Cognitive processing; Data producers; Data production; Dual-process theories; Electronic health record; Trust modeling; Data reduction,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"3rd IEEE/ACM International Workshop on Software Engineering for Healthcare, SEH 2021",3 June 2021,"Virtual, Online",Conference paper,Final,

The impact of scoliosis can be extreme with significant curvature of the spine that often progresses during childhood periods of growth and development. Gauging the impact of treatment is vital throughout the diagnostic and treatment process and is achieved using radiographic imaging and patient reported feedback surveys. Surgeons from multiple clinical centers have amassed a wealth of patient data from more than 1,000 scoliosis patients. However, these data are difficult to access due to data heterogeneity and poor interoperability between complex hospital systems. These barriers significantly decrease the value of these data to improve patient care. To solve these challenges, we create a generalizable multi-site and multi-modality cloud infrastructure for managing the clinical data of multiple diseases. First, we establish a standardized and secure research data repository using the Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard to harmonize multi-modal clinical data from different hospital sites. Additionally, we develop a SMART-on-FHIR application with a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to enable non-Technical users to access the harmonized clinical data. We demonstrate the generalizability of our solution by expanding it to also facilitate craniofacial microsomia and pediatric bone disease imaging research. Ultimately, we present a generalized framework for multi-site, multimodal data harmonization, which can efficiently organize and store data for clinical research to improve pediatric patient care. © 2022 Owner/Author.",Data interoperability; Data repository; ETL; FHIR; Pediatric patient care; SMART-on-FHIR; User interface,Clinical research; Diagnosis; Graphical user interfaces; Hospital data processing; Hospitals; Patient treatment; Pediatrics; Clinical data; Data interoperability; Data repositories; ETL; Fast health interoperability resource; Multi-site; Patient care; Pediatric patient care; Pediatric patients; SMART-on-fast health interoperability resource; Interoperability,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","13th ACM International Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology and Health Informatics, BCB 2022",7 August 2022 through 8 August 2022,Chicago,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access

Existing studies and frameworks presented some solutions to overcome the problem of specification and application of clinical guidelines toward the automation of their use at the point of care. However, they could not yet support thoroughly the dynamic use of medical knowledge in EMRs according to the clinical contexts and provide local application of international recommendations. This study presents the development of the Clinical Knowledge Platform (CKP): a collaborative interoperable environment to create, use, and share sets of information elements that we entitled Clinical Use Contexts (CUCs). A CUC could include medical forms, patient dashboards, and order sets that are usable in various EMRs. For this purpose, we have identified and developed three basic requirements: an interoperable, inter-mapped dictionary of concepts leaning on standard terminologies, the possibility to define relevant clinical contexts, and an interface for collaborative content production via communities of professionals. Community members work together to create and/or modify, CUCs based on different clinical contexts. These CUCs will then be uploaded to be used in clinical applications in various EMRs. With this method, each CUC is, on the one hand, specific to a clinical context and on the other hand, could be adapted to the local practice conditions and constraints. Once a CUC has been developed, it could be shared with other potential users that can consume it directly or modify it according to their needs.  © 2022 European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI) and IOS Press.",Electronic Medical Records; Health Information Interoperability; Practice Guideline; Terminology,Interoperability; Medical computing; Medical informatics; Clinical knowledge; Clinical use; Electronic medical record; Health information interoperability; Health informations; Information interoperability; Medical record; Order sets; Practice guideline; Use context; adult; conference paper; data interoperability; ecosystem; electronic medical record; human; nomenclature; practice guideline; article; Terminology,IOS Press BV,"2022 European Federation for Medical Informatics Special Topic Conference: Digital Professionalism in Health and Care: Developing the Workforce, Building the Future, STC 2022",7 September 2022 through 8 September 2022,Cardiff,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access

How to accommodate heterogeneous medical coding systems across different hospitals? Standard approaches rely on existing medical code mapping tools, which have several practical limitations. To tackle this problem, we propose AutoMap to automatically map the medical codes across different EHR systems in a coarse-to-fine manner: (1) Ontology-level Alignment: We leverage the ontology structure to learn a coarse alignment between the source and target medical coding systems; (2) Code-level Refinement: We refine the alignment at a fine-grained code level for the downstream tasks using a teacher-student framework. We evaluate AutoMap using several deep learning models with two real-world EHR datasets: eICU and MIMIC-III. Results show that AutoMap achieves relative improvements up to 3.9% (AUC-ROC) and 8.7% (AUC-PR) for mortality prediction, and up to 4.7% (AUC-ROC) and 3.7% (F1) for length-of-stay estimation. Further, we show that AutoMap can provide accurate mapping across coding systems. Lastly, we demonstrate that AutoMap can adapt to two challenging scenarios: (1) mapping between completely different coding systems and (2) between completely different hospitals. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Clinical prediction model deployment; Electronic health records; Medical code mapping,Alignment; Codes (symbols); Deep learning; Forecasting; Hospitals; Learning systems; Medical computing; Ontology; Signal encoding; Clinical prediction model deployment; Coding system; Electronic health; Electronic health record; Health records; Learning models; Mapping tools; Medical code mapping; Ontology's; Prediction modelling; Mapping,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,"22nd Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases, ECML PKDD 2022",19 September 2022 through 23 September 2022,Grenoble,Conference paper,Final,

Objectives: We wanted to examine the success and failures of tranSMART in the fields of translational research and education by looking at the examples of six use cases at our hospital. We wanted to point out suitable scenarios and user groups as well as still existing challenges and limitations. Methods: We sum up the experience we made with our use cases with a focus on lessons learned. Results: TranSMART was successfully established by a bottom-up approach at our university hospital and has been running for more than two years now. It has been used in four translational research projects as well as in education in the context of lectures and bachelor/master theses. Conclusion: TranSMART can be a very useful tool for translational research and education. But it should be used with both care and statistical knowledge to avoid wrong conclusions. Some technical constraints, especially for data modeling, still limit many applications.

A popular open source implementation of FHIR is the Java-based HAPI. It provides generic FHIR-compatible Representational State Transfer (REST) interfaces for data access. One weak point of this solution is the lack of client side support. It supports only Java-based client environments. This is useful in the case of Android-based native client, but for the JavaScript or TypeScript-based full stack environments a JavaScript-based environment is needed. Here, we present our solution which integrates HAPI into a JavaScript-based full stack environment.

Subsequently the prototype was implemented and successfully tested in interoperability tests. The study shows that the architecture meets the requirements.

A commonly adopted solution to manage complex and real MASs is adopting a Model Driven methodology, which uses an ontology as the formal representation of the domain, and then exploiting some existing tool to automatically generate code for agents in the MAS, to let them interact according to the model. While this approach is satisfactorily supported when the target MAS environment is Jason, less support is provided to Jade MASs, despite Jade's large adoption for real MASs development. So, considering the great support given by the automatic code generation starting from a formal model, and the large community working on Jade MASs, in this work we present an extension of the OntologyBeanGenerator plugin for Protégé, used to generate a Java representation of an OWL ontology for Jade. We improved the OntologyBeanGenerator tool to support the modeling of exceptions, formalized at the ontology level, and of methods associated with ontology elements, to set the interface of concrete objects (artifacts) at design stage. This extension allows us to integrate in a Model Driven approach a support for the formal definition of artifacts and provide an automatic generation of Jade code/interfaces to interact with them respecting the model. © Copyright 2018 for the individual papers by the papers' authors.",Automatic code generation; Jade; Model driven design; Multiagent systems; Ontologies; OntologybeanGenerator,,CEUR-WS,"19th Workshop ""From Objects to Agents"", WOA 2018",28 June 2018 through 29 June 2018,Palermo,Conference paper,Final,

An electronic search was conducted, and 27 studies were included in the scoping review after the selection process.

Emerging research suggests these connected tools can result improved health outcomes and sustainable self-health management. However, current health technology frameworks limit flexibility, engagement, and reusability of underlying connected health components. The objective of this paper is to develop a data-driven consumer engagement framework, which we call Digilego, to facilitate development of connected health solutions that are targeted, modular, extensible, and engaging. The major components include social media analysis, patient engagement features, and behavioral intervention technologies. We propose implementation of these Digilego components using FHIR specification such that the resulting technology is compliant to industry standards. We apply and evaluate the proposed framework to characterize four individual building blocks (DigiMe, DigiSocial, DigiConnect, DigiEHR) for a connected health solution that is responsive to cancer survivor needs. Results indicate that the framework (a) allows identification of survivor needs (e.g. social integration, treatment side effects) through semi-automated social media analysis, (b) facilitates infusion of engagement elements (e.g. smart health trackers, integrated electronic health records), and (c) integrates behavior change constructs into the design architecture of survivorship applications (e.g. goal setting, emotional coping).

However, the lack of plug and play interoperability between them is a major bottleneck, significantly restricting their exploitation potential. This paper presents a novel infrastructure developed for enabling the seamless integration between such systems, focusing on the use of state-of-the-art, widely accepted, interfaces. The infrastructure effectively supports end-user needs for integrated care, bringing linked EHR information from multiple providers at the point of care by means of personal health apps. Integration is provided through cross-enterprise document sharing (XDS) and fast healthcare interoperability resources (FHIR) services. The described infrastructure facilitates interoperability by enabling citizens to use a personal health app of their choosing for accessing own medical record information stored at multiple sites, by combining the benefits and potential of both XDS and FHIR. © 2019 IEEE.",Electronic Health Record; FHIR; Hospital Information Systems; Interoperability; Personal Health Apps; XDS,Health; Interface states; Records management; Electronic health record; Electronic health record systems; Exploitation potentials; FHIR; Healthcare Interoperability; Hospital information systems; Personal health; Seamless integration; Interoperability,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"32nd IEEE International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems, CBMS 2019",5 June 2019 through 7 June 2019,Cordoba,Conference paper,Final,

Furthermore, the lifestyle supported by environmental degradation and soaring resource consumption jeopardizes people's health and wellbeing. In this paper, we evaluate, from the UV perspective, the challenges of the healthcare system and the current status of the smart healthcare system based on the framework of closed feedback control loop: data acquisition, communication, decision making and action. We propose that an effective smart healthcare system should take into consideration of the interaction between the smart healthcare system and other seven smart city subsystems: smart home, intelligent transportation, urban planning and crowd management, smart energy management, smart city infrastructure, smart response system for city emergency, smart environmental protection and smart humanity, and also study how the smart healthcare system would be affected by four major impacting factors of smart cities: information flow, material cycle, lifestyle and community. This systematic study will help us explore in depth the complicated dynamic relationship between multiple impacting factors and propose a UV-oriented, integrated, re-silient, inclusive and sustainable development framework design to address current imminent challenges and to improve human health through patient-oriented monitoring, life-long healthcare data management, personalized lifestyle guidance and suggestions, preventive healthcare, and timely treatment. © 2020 IEEE.",closed feedback control loop; dynamic relationship; information flow; lifestyle and community; material cycle; Smart Healthcare System; UV perspective,Automation; Behavioral research; Control systems; Data acquisition; Decision making; Environmental protection; Materials handling; Patient treatment; Privacy by design; Rural areas; Smart city; Sustainable development; Urban transportation; Development frameworks; Feedback control loops; Health-care system; Healthcare resources; Intelligent transportation; Resource consumption; Safety and securities; Smart healthcare systems; Information management,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"5th International Conference on Universal Village, UV 2020",24 October 2020 through 27 October 2020,Boston,Conference paper,Final,

Pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) is a complex, dynamic condition associated with large amounts of clinical data and frequent decisions at the bedside. Novel data-driven technologies that can help screen, prompt, and support clinician decision-making could have a significant impact on patient outcomes. We sought to identify and summarize relevant evidence related to clinical informatics interventions in both PARDS and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), for the second Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Elsevier), and CINAHL Complete (EBSCOhost). STUDY SELECTION: We included studies of pediatric or adult critically ill patients with or at risk of ARDS that examined automated screening tools, electronic algorithms, or clinical decision support systems. DATA EXTRACTION: Title/abstract review, full text review, and data extraction using a standardized data extraction form. DATA SYNTHESIS: The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was used to identify and summarize evidence and develop recommendations. Twenty-six studies were identified for full text extraction to address the Patient/Intervention/Comparator/Outcome questions, and 14 were used for the recommendations/statements. Two clinical recommendations were generated, related to the use of electronic screening tools and automated monitoring of compliance with best practice guidelines. Two research statements were generated, related to the development of multicenter data collaborations and the design of generalizable algorithms and electronic tools. One policy statement was generated, related to the provision of material and human resources by healthcare organizations to empower clinicians to develop clinical informatics interventions to improve the care of patients with PARDS. CONCLUSIONS: We present two clinical recommendations and three statements (two research one policy) for the use of electronic algorithms and clinical informatics tools for patients with PARDS based on a systematic review of the literature and expert consensus.

The emerging HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) framework appeals to developers and clinicians alike and is a promising candidate to modernise this domain. Novel IEEE 11073 standard proposals that specify a service-oriented architecture of networked medical devices are one example for an ICE architecture. They are based on expressing a device's capabilities and state in a machine-readable way in order to be safely accessed and manipulated by other participants in the networked device system. In this work, the domain information and service model of this ICE architecture was mapped to FHIR resources that were constrained and extended to support the modelling of this device architecture. Through the definition of a FHIR profile, the data structures were aligned, effectively allowing for the transformation of medical device observation data from ICE to FHIR representation without the need for any proprietary interface. The implementation of this transformation, e. g. as a gateway, bridges the structural interoperability gap between two contemporary communication architectures for medical devices and clinical information systems and thus lays the foundation for semantic interoperability that can be achieved through the combined use with controlled vocabularies. The consequent availability of device data enables secondary usage such as large-scale data analytics. Future sub-profiles for specific device types further simplify the transformation. © 2016 IEEE.",,Biomedical equipment; Distributed computer systems; Electronic data interchange; Gateways (computer networks); Ice; Information services; Information systems; Interoperability; Metadata; Semantics; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Standards; Clinical information system; Communication architectures; Data Exchange Standard; Device architectures; Domain informations; Healthcare Interoperability; Integrated clinical environments; Semantic interoperability; Medical information systems,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2016 IEEE Conference on Standards for Communications and Networking, CSCN 2016",31 October 2016 through 2 November 2016,Berlin,Conference paper,Final,

Prior research has identified the potential for improved communication between healthcare provider and patient. However the practice of sharing patient generated wellness data has not been widely adopted by the healthcare sector; one of the reasons being the lack of interoperability preventing successful integration of such device generated data into the PHR and Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems. To address the interoperability issue it is important to make sure that wellness data can be supported in healthcare information exchange standards. Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is used in the current research study to identify the technical feasibility for patient generated wellness data.

However, healthcare data can be sensitive in nature and as such difficult to share and make use for secondary purposes. Healthcare vendors are restricted to share data without proper consent from the patient. There is a rising awareness among individual patients as well regarding sharing their personal information due to ethical, legal and societal problems. The current data-sharing platforms in healthcare do not sufficiently handle these issues. The rationale of the Personal Health Train (PHT) approach shifts the focus from sharing data to sharing processing/analysis applications and their respective results. A prerequisite of the PHT-infrastructure is that the data is FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable).

We leveraged Shiny with R to develop interactive interfaces on FHIR-based data and used ovarian cancer study datasets as a use case to implement a prototype. Specifically, we implemented patient index, patient-centered data report and analysis, and cohort analysis. The evaluation of our study was performed by testing the adaptability of the framework on two public FHIR servers. We identify common research requirements and current outstanding issues, and discuss future enhancement work of the current studies. Overall, our study demonstrated that it is feasible to use Shiny for implementing interactive analysis on FHIR-based standardized clinical data. © 2017 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) and IOS Press.",Data interpretation; Health level seven; Reference standards; Statistical,Electronic Health Records; Health Level Seven; Humans; Medical Informatics; Computer programming; Application platforms; Data interpretation; Integrated frameworks; Interactive analysis; Interactive interfaces; Reference standard; Statistical; Web application frameworks; electronic health record; health level 7; human; medical informatics; Health care,IOS Press,"16th World Congress of Medical and Health Informatics: Precision Healthcare through Informatics, MedInfo 2017",21 August 2017 through 25 August 2017,Hangzhou,Conference paper,Final,

FHIR is engaging and evolving rapidly and it is creating the need of massive data storage, retrieval and transfer requirements. For a server that implements this framework, has to be agile to cope with the growing and massive data handling. E-health-care data also seem to grow proportional to time. So, an ideal FHIR Server has to be scalable to fit this demand over time. Several different tools could help store, anonymize, analyze and extract data because there are no single tools to get all those things done. In this work, we propose a scalable, agile, and reliable Micro-service based Architecture for FHIR server that is highly available with the help of Document Oriented Database and helps to store health-care data. The proposed architecture is fast responsive. It gives our system the flexibility to use different tools that implement FHIR Framework interface in such way that the whole system could be made vertically scalable and the system can perform better in terms of time complexity compared to a Monolithic based implementation of the framework.

These include Electronic Health record managed by the government, Electronic Medical Record (EMR) managed by healthcare providers, Personal Health Record (PHR) managed directly by the patient and new Blockchain-based systems mainly managed by technologies. Health record repositories differ from one another on the level of security, privacy, and quality of services (QoS) they provide. Health data stored in these repositories also varies from patient to patient in sensitivity, and significance depending on medical, personal preference, and other factors. Decisions regarding which digital record repository is most appropriate for the storage of each data item at every point in time are complex and nuanced. The challenges are exacerbated with health data continuously streamed from wearable sensors. In this paper, we propose a recommendation model for health data storage that can accommodate patient preferences and make storage decisions rapidly, in real-time, even with streamed data. The model maps health data to be stored in the repositories. The mapping between health data features and characteristics of each repository is learned using a machine learning-based classifier mediated through clinical rules.

In opposition, risks such as a lack of or uncertainty about regulations prompt the provider to close the platform to uphold control which in turn reduces the benefits for potential suppliers.

The prediction aspect embedded in the system helps in avoiding delays in providing timely medical treatment, even before an individual reaches a critical condition. Despite of the availability of modern wearable health monitoring devices, the real-time analyses and prediction component seems to be missing with these devices. The research work illustrated in this paper, at an outset, focussed on constantly monitoring an individual's ECG readings using a wearable 3-lead ECG kit and more importantly focussed on performing real-time analyses to detect arrhythmia to be able to identify and predict heart risk. Also, current research shows extensive use of heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and machine learning for arrhythmia classification, which however depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the ECG equipment. Since a wearable 3-lead ECG kit was used, the accuracy of classification had to be dealt with at the machine learning phase, so a unique feature extraction method was developed to increase the accuracy of classification. As a case study a very widely used Arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH, Physionet) was used to develop learning, classification and prediction models. Neuralnet fitting models on the extracted features showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. Current experiments show 99.4% accuracy using k-NN Classification models and show values of Cross-Entropy Error of 7.6 and misclassification error value of 1.2 on test data using scaled conjugate gradient pattern matching algorithms. Software components were developed for wearable devices that took ECG readings from a 3-Lead ECG data acquisition kit in real time, de-noised, filtered and relayed the sample readings to the tele health analytical server. The analytical server performed the classification and prediction tasks based on the trained classification models and could raise appropriate alarms if ECG abnormalities of V (Premature Ventricular Contraction: PVC), A (Atrial Premature Beat: APB), L (Left bundle branch block beat), R (Right bundle branch block beat) type annotations in MITDB were detected. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and abnormal ECG events related to arrhythmia, from analytical server could be logged using an FHIR web service implementation, according to a SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions. The system focused on 'preventive care rather than remedial cure' which has become a major focus of all the health care and cure institutions across the globe. © 2017 IEEE.",arrhythmia detection; arrhythmia Neural-Net; ECG classification; FHIR; GP Connect; HL7; MITDB; Physionet; preventive health-care; real-time ECG; Wearable IoT,Artificial intelligence; Biohazards; Classification (of information); Curing; Data acquisition; Diseases; Electrocardiography; Errors; Forecasting; Health care; Health hazards; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Mean square error; Nearest neighbor search; Pattern matching; Social networking (online); Web services; Arrhythmia detection; Ecg classifications; FHIR; MITDB; PhysioNet; Real time; Wearable IoT; Wearable technology,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2017 International Conference On Social Media, Wearable And Web Analytics, Social Media 2017",19 June 2017 through 20 June 2017,London,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access

EHR usually contains a mixture of structured (codes) and unstructured (free-text) data with sparse and irregular longitudinal features – all of which doctors utilize when making decisions. In the deep learning regime, determining how different modality representations should be fused together is a difficult problem, which is often addressed by handcrafted modeling and intuition. In this work, we extend state-of-the-art neural architecture search (NAS) methods and propose MUltimodal Fusion Architecture SeArch (MUFASA) to simultaneously search across multimodal fusion strategies and modality-specific architectures for the first time. We demonstrate empirically that our MUFASA method outperforms established unimodal NAS on public EHR data with comparable computation costs. In addition, MUFASA produces architectures that outperform Transformer and Evolved Transformer. Compared with these baselines on CCS diagnosis code prediction, our discovered models improve top-5 recall from 0.88 to 0.91 and demonstrate the ability to generalize to other EHR tasks. Studying our top architecture in depth, we provide empirical evidence that MUFASA’s improvements are derived from its ability to both customize modeling for each data modality and find effective fusion strategies.

This system can store and share raw EMR and life log data based on the healthcare communication standard 'HL7 FHIR'. To validate the usability of the interconnected PHR system, a clinical trial is underway to develop an obesity management model from individuals' hospital-provided genomic data, on the one hand, and diet and exercise logs gathered by the mobile application, on the other. We demonstrate how the proposed IoT Cloud based PHR ecosystem is interoperable and practical for promoting healthcare big data analysis services. © 2017 IEEE.",ARTIK; Cloud; FHIR; Healthcare; HL7; IoT; PHR,Big data; Clouds; Data handling; Ecology; Ecosystems; Electronic document exchange; Health care; Hospitals; Information analysis; Information management; Internet of things; Interoperability; Medical computing; Medical information systems; Mobile computing; Mobile telecommunication systems; ARTIK; Communication standards; Data-communication; Electronic medical records (EMRs); FHIR; Hospital information systems; Mobile applications; Personal health record; Data communication systems,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"5th IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics, ICHI 2017",23 August 2017 through 26 August 2017,Park City,Conference paper,Final,

Modern wearable health monitoring devices have become easily available in the consumer market, however, real-Time analyses and prediction along with alerts and alarms about a health hazard are not adequately addressed in such devices. Taking ECG monitoring as a case study the research paper focusses on signal processing, arrhythmia detection and classification and at the same time focusses on updating the electronic health records database in realtime such that the concerned medical practitioners become aware of an emergent situation the patient being monitored might face. Also, heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is usually considered as a basis for arrhythmia classification which largely depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the biopotential measurements of the ECG kits, so it may not yield accurate results. Initially, the ECG readings from the 3-Lead ECG analog front-end were de-noised, zero-offset corrected, filtered using recursive least square adaptive filter and smoothed using Savitzky-Golay filter and subsequently passed to the data analysis component with a unique feature extraction method to increase the accuracy of classification. The machine learning models trained on MITDB arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH Physionet) showed more than 97% accuracy using kNN classifiers. Neuralnet fitting models showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. ECG abnormalities based on annotations in MITDB could be classified and these ECG observations could be logged to a server implementation based on FHIR standards. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and ECG event observations were coded according to SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions. The system emphasizes on 'preventive care rather than remedial cure' as the next generation personalized health-care monitoring devices become available. © 2017 IEEE.",Arrhythmia classification; Arrhythmia detection; Arrhythmia Neural-Net; ECG FHIR; ECG signal processing; GP Connect; HAPI FHIR; Healthcare monitoring; HL7; MITDB Physionet; SNOMED-CT FHIR; Wearable IoT,Adaptive filtering; Adaptive filters; Bioelectric potentials; Classification (of information); Diseases; Electrocardiography; Health care; Health hazards; Internet of things; Interoperability; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Least squares approximations; Mean square error; Medical computing; Real time systems; Records management; Wearable technology; Arrhythmia classification; Arrhythmia detection; ECG signal processing; HAPI FHIR; Healthcare monitoring; PhysioNet; SNOMED-CT; Wearable IoT; Biomedical signal processing,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"7th International Conference on Internet Technologies and Applications, ITA 2017",12 September 2017 through 15 September 2017,Wrexham,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access

FHIR promises to facilitate the use of electronic health records (EHRs), enable mobile technologies and make health data accessible to large-scale analytics. Until now, there is no comprehensive review of scientific articles about FHIR and its use in digital health. Here, we aim to address this gap and provide an overview of the main topics associated with FHIR in the scientific literature. For this, we screened all articles about FHIR on Web of Science and PubMed and identified the main topics discussed in these articles. We also explored the temporal trend and geography of publications and performed some basic text mining on article abstracts. We found that the topics most commonly discussed in the articles were related to data models, mobile and web applications as well as medical devices. Since its introduction, the number of publications about FHIR have steadily increased until 2017, indicating an increasing popularity of FHIR in healthcare (in 2018, publication numbers remained stable). In sum, our study provides an overview of the scientific literature about FHIR and its current use in digital health. © 2019 The authors and IOS Press.",Health information interoperability; Review literature,Data Mining; Electronic Health Records; Medical Informatics; PubMed; Health care; Interoperability; Text mining; Electronic health record (EHRs); Health information technologies; Health informations; Healthcare Interoperability; International standards; Large-scale analytics; Scientific articles; Scientific literature; data mining; electronic health record; medical informatics; Medline; Medical informatics,IOS Press,"64th Annual Meeting of the German Association of Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology: Shaping Change � Creative Solutions for Innovative Medicine, GMDS 2019",8 September 2019 through 11 September 2019,Dortmund,Conference paper,Final,

Unfortunately, there are many low-quality, unsafe health apps, resulting in different types of risks. This Perspective addresses the current failure to adopt standards for the development and implementation of health apps. For each theoretical stage of the app development lifecycle we discuss problems, examples, reasons, and solutions. We believe that adapted versions of existing professional and technical standards and tools developed for clinical information systems, medical devices and medicines could help mitigate risks throughout the health app lifecycle. Adapted standards should bring more effective user involvement and cooperation amongst stakeholders. We argue that these efforts will ultimately provide users with a wider choice of higher-quality health apps, give healthcare providers access to better quality data, and allow developers to innovate without unnecessary time-consuming restrictions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Digital health; Health apps; Medical device legislation [MeSH]; Mobile applications [MeSH]; Standards,Cell Phone; Data Accuracy; Humans; Mobile Applications; Risk Assessment; Telemedicine; editorial; health care personnel; human; medical device regulation; medical information system; mobile application; theoretical study; devices; measurement accuracy; mobile phone; risk assessment; telemedicine,Elsevier Ireland Ltd,,,,Editorial,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access

In 2014 a panel of ACMI fellows debated the following proposition: ""The lack of interaction and collaboration between health IT vendors and academic clinical informatics units is stifling innovation and will continue to have a detrimental effect on the evolution of commercial products."" Debaters disagreed on the level of interaction and collaboration between the health IT sector and academia and disagreed on whether and by whom innovation was actually taking place. While collaboration between industry and academia was seen as desirable by all of the debaters, there was an acknowledgment that these groups have notably different roles and responsibilities. There was consensus that a path forward should be found, and that AMIA itself has an important role to play in effecting this. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Electronic health records; Health information technology; Industry; Technological innovation; Universities,"Access to Information; Commerce; Consumer Health Information; Cooperative Behavior; Diffusion of Innovation; Health Policy; Humans; Medical Informatics; Medical Records Systems, Computerized; Societies, Medical; Software; United States; Universities; American college of medical informatics; data analysis; electronic medical record; human; medical informatics; medical practice; medical research; medical school; medical service; medical society; Note; organizational downsizing; organizational efficiency; priority journal; public-private partnership; access to information; commercial phenomena; consumer health information; cooperation; economics; electronic medical record system; health care policy; mass communication; medical informatics; medical society; organization and management; procedures; software; United States; university",Academic Press Inc.,,,,Note,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access

The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network's Phase III program initially used a commercially developed XML message format for standardized and structured representation of genetic results for electronic health record (EHR) integration. In a desire to move towards a standard representation, the network created a new standardized format based upon Health Level Seven Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (HL7® FHIR®), to represent clinical genomics results.

Increased adoption of Health Level Seven Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) application programming interfaces (APIs) in recent years by EHR systems has increased the availability of patient data for external applications such as REDCap. Objective: Describe the development of the REDCap Clinical Data Interoperability Services (CDIS) module that provides seamless data exchange between the REDCap research EDC and any EHR system with a FHIR API. CDIS enables end users to independently set up their data collection projects, map EHR data to fields, and adjudicate data transfer without project-by-project involvement from Health Information Technology staff. Methods: We identified two use cases for EHR data transfer into REDCap. Clinical Data Pull (CDP) automatically pulls EHR data into user-defined REDCap fields and replaces the workflow of having to transcribe or copy and paste data from the EHR. Clinical Data Mart (CDM) collects all specified data for a patient over a given time period and replaces the process of importing EHR data for registries from research databases. With an iterative process, we designed our access control, authentication, variable selection, and mapping interfaces in such a way that end users could easily set up and use CDIS. Results: Since its release, the REDCap CDIS has been used to pull over 19.5 million data points for 82 projects at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Software and documentation are available through the REDCap Consortium. Conclusions: The new REDCap Clinical Data and Interoperability Services (CDIS) module leverages the FHIR standard to enable real-time and direct data extraction from the EHR. Researchers can self-service the mapping and adjudication of EHR data into REDCap. The uptake of CDIS at VUMC and other REDCap consortium sites is improving the accuracy and efficiency of EHR data collection by reducing the need for manual transcription and flat file uploads. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Clinical research; Electronic data capture; Electronic health record; Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources,adult; clinical research; data extraction; data interoperability; data warehouse; electronic health record; Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources; genetic transcription; human; note; software; university hospital; workflow; article,Academic Press Inc.,,,,Note,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access

Despite notable accomplishments and successes, wide adoption and broad use of CDS in clinical practice has not been achieved. Many issues have been identified as being partially responsible for the relatively slow adoption and lack of impact, including deficiencies in leadership, recognition of purpose, understanding of human interaction and workflow implications of CDS, cognitive models of the role of CDS, and proprietary implementations with limited interoperability and sharing. To address limitations, many approaches have been proposed and evaluated, drawing on theoretical frameworks, as well as management, technical and other disciplines and experiences. It seems clear, because of the multiple perspectives involved, that no single model or framework is adequate to encompass these challenges. This Viewpoint paper seeks to review the various foci of CDS and to identify aspects in which theoretical models and frameworks for CDS have been explored or could be explored and where they might be expected to be most useful. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Clinical decision support; Knowledge models; Knowledge representation,"Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Decision Support Techniques; Humans; Clinical research; Knowledge representation; Clinical decision support; Clinical practices; Cognitive model; Human interactions; Implementation success; Knowledge model; Research issues; Theoretical framework; clinical decision support system; clinical practice; conceptual framework; data interoperability; leadership; man machine interaction; Note; priority journal; workflow; decision support system; human; Decision support systems",Academic Press Inc.,,,,Note,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access

While radiation oncologists already navigate a pool of clinical (semantic) and imaging data, the tide will swell with the advent of hybrid MRI/linear accelerator devices and increasing interest in MRI-guided radiotherapy (MRIgRT), including adaptive MRIgRT. The variety of MR sequences (of greater complexity than the single parameter Hounsfield unit of CT scanning routinely used in radiotherapy), the workflow of adaptive fractionation, and the sheer quantity of daily images acquired are challenges for scaling this technology. Biomedical informatics, which is the science of information in biomedicine, can provide helpful insights for this looming transition. Funneling MRIgRT data into clinically meaningful information streams requires committing to the flow of inter-institutional data accessibility and interoperability initiatives, standardizing MRIgRT dosimetry methods, streamlining MR linear accelerator workflow, and standardizing MRI acquisition and post-processing.
