Previously closed Electronic Medical Record systems are gradually opened to third party applications through FHIR-enabled APIs. While this allows for technical interoperability, patient safety concerns from data quality issues with the underlying system data remain unsolved. We propose to apply a “Data Quality by Contract” approach to pre- and post-conditions of data use cases to assure safe operation of SMART on FHIR apps. We demonstrate how a cardiac risk scoring app could leverage data quality probes to validate several data quality concerns.","","978-1-7281-7415-0","10.1109/ICSA-C50368.2020.00041","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9095642","SMART on FHIR;data quality;safety;electronic medical records;software engineering;health information systems","Probes;Data integrity;Diabetes;Safety;Standards;Contracts","","6","","28","IEEE","19 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Exchange of healthcare data usually follows HL7 (Health Level 7) standard. Latest among HL7 is FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources). In this paper, we look into an idea to connect the diagnostic devices such as hematology analyzers with the Electronic Medical Records (EMR), to transfer the analysis to the care givers as soon it is done. We also provide an example of how this can be used in early detection of some of the medical conditions such as sepsis, chronic conditions, and other clinical decision support systems, where it needs immediate treatment from the care givers and how the SMART on FHIR helps to achieve the same","","978-1-6654-5635-7","10.1109/ICERECT56837.2022.10060121","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060121","SMART on FHIR;Healthcare Data Exchange;HL7;EMR;CDSS","Decision support systems;Pediatrics;Ventilators;Medical devices;Surgery;Sepsis;Prediction algorithms","","","","14","IEEE","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is a key prerequisite to many clinical analytics applications, yet much of the research to date focuses on assessing data quality of electronic health records for secondary use. This paper proposes a trust model and provenance-based assessment method for considering data quality during clinical decision making at the point of care. The method uses fuzzy logic to infer data quality trust from a data user's trust preferences with respect to data producers, data production methods, verification of data items, and certification of data production methods. Implementation with an existing “SMART on FHIR” app in primary care demonstrates the feasibility of model and method. An extension to FHIR resources for data quality trust allows for platform interoperability across system contexts. We consider dual process theories in designing a user interface that supports data quality trust for clinical decisions in heuristic and systematic cognitive processing modes. Model and method are adaptable to other application domains that rely on data quality for decision making.","","978-1-6654-4458-3","10.1109/SEH52539.2021.00012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9470891","data quality assessment;trust models;clinical decision support;fuzzy inference;electronic health records;SMART on FHIR;user interface design","Adaptation models;Data integrity;Decision making;Point of care;Production;User interfaces;Data models","","3","","34","IEEE","7 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The cost of healthcare is increasing primarily due to growing populations and more expensive treatment. Health facilities in many countries are reaching their full operational capacity, and their resources %of these hospitals are less than what is required to deliver the expected quality of care. Under these circumstances, ICT has a major role to play in mitigating the growing need for hospital care. In this paper, we present a cloud-based interoperable architecture built on the top of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) for Internet-based treatment where patients can directly interact with underlying healthcare systems such as Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Based on this architecture, we also present a prototype for screening and monitoring of mental and neurological health morbidities. The proposed solution is based on the healthcare interoperability standard, HL7 FHIR, that enables healthcare providers to assess and monitor patients condition in a secure environment.","","978-1-7281-2251-9","10.1109/SEH.2019.00008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8823897","service-oriented architecture, healthcare, self-screening, HL7 FHIR, SMART on FHIR, Internet-based Treatments","Medical services;Monitoring;Service-oriented architecture;Servers;Authorization;Standards;Interoperability","","12","","45","IEEE","5 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite the growing popularity of FHIR, the available evidence provides a compelling reason to believe that its use is still accompanied by a significant number of technical challenges. Therefore, the development of tools to ensure its convenient visualization remains a pressing need for a variety of stakeholders operating in the healthcare industry. Results of the systematic literature review that included 26 studies provide valuable information about the most popular instruments in this area, such as the OpenEHR CKM approach. The review offers a critical discussion of the most important advantages and disadvantages of different approaches. It provides valuable recommendations for further research as well as practical recommendations concerning the best ways to utilize data visualization platforms based on FHIR. It defines the tradeoff of functionality versus the ease of dissemination as one of the most important problems facing most platforms and suggests avenues for developing additional tooling support for visualizing FHIR.
