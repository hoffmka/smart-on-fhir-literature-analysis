Vincent C. Henrich, Lori A. Orlando, and Brian H. Shirts discuss the practical considerations surrounding the use of genomic and genetic tests to manage patient health, to provide adult disease risk assessment, to improve diagnosis, and to support effective interventions and treatment. In 10 chapters, evidence-based information and case studies are described and examine the central place of family health history (FHH) in genomic medicine, tools and strategies for compiling and analyzing family health history, how to identify existing and novel genetic markers, how to identify lineage specific (or rare) variants within families, and how to find effective interventions based on genetic testing results and FHH. Factors that influence clinical practice, including gene-environment interactions, FHH social networking, direct to consumer (DTC) genetic testing and data sharing, algorithms for analyzing genetic data, and patient counseling are discussed from the standpoint of clinical practice. Here, frontline healthcare providers will discover succinct commentary and key examples to assist with their local needs. Relevant principles of genetic biology and inheritance are explored and guidance on available support networks and online resources is also provided. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

It goes on to discuss health informatics from an historical perspective, its current state and its likely future state now that electronic health record systems are widely deployed, the HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability standard is being rapidly accepted as the means to access the data stored in those systems and analytics is increasing being used to gain new knowledge from that aggregated clinical data. It then turns to some of the important and evolving areas of informatics including population and public health, mHealth and big data and analytics. Use cases and case studies are used in all of these discussions to help readers connect the technologies to real world challenges.Effective use of informatics systems and tools by providers and their patients is key to improving the quality, safety and cost of healthcare. With health records now digital, no effective means has existed for sharing them with patients, among the multiple providers who may care for them and for important secondary uses such as public/population health and research. This problem is a topic of congressional discussion and is addressed by the 21st Century Cures Act of 2016 that mandates that electronic health record (EHR) systems offer a patient-facing API.HL7’s Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is that API and this is the first comprehensive treatment of the technology and the many ways it is already being used. FHIR is based on web technologies and is thus a far more facile, easy to implement approach that is rapidly gaining acceptance. It is also the basis for a ‘universal health app platform’ that literally has the potential to foster innovation around the data in patient records similar to the app ecosystems smartphones created around the data they store. FHIR app stores have already been opened by Epic and Cerner, the two largest enterprise EHR vendors.Provider facing apps are already being explored to improve EHR usability and support personalized medicine. Medicare and the Veteran’s Administration have announced FHIR app platforms for their patients. Apple’s new IOS 11.3 features the ability for consumers to aggregate their health records on their iPhone using FHIR. Health insurance companies are exploring applications of FHIR to improve service and communication with their providers and patients. SureScripts, the national e-Prescribing network, is using FHIR to help doctors know if their patients are complying with prescriptions.This textbook is for introductory health informatics courses for computer science and health sciences students (e.g. doctors, nurses, PhDs), the current health informatics community, IT professionals interested in learning about the field and practicing healthcare providers. Though this textbook covers an important new technology, it is accessible to non-technical readers including healthcare providers, their patients or anyone interested in the use of healthcare data for improved care, public/population health or research. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

It provides continuous, person-centered, relationship-based care that considers the needs and preferences of individuals, families, and communities. Without access to high-quality primary care, minor health problems can spiral into chronic disease, chronic disease management becomes difficult and uncoordinated, visits to emergency departments increase, preventive care lags, and health care spending soars to unsustainable levels. Unequal access to primary care remains a concern, and the COVID-19 pandemic amplified pervasive economic, mental health, and social health disparities that ubiquitous, high-quality primary care might have reduced. Primary care is the only health care component where an increased supply is associated with better population health and more equitable outcomes. For this reason, primary care is a common good, which makes the strength and quality of the country’s primary care services a public concern. Implementing High-Quality Primary Care: Rebuilding the Foundation of Health Care puts forth an evidence-based plan with actionable objectives and recommendations for implementing high-quality primary care in the United States.

These diabetes technologies generate a wealth of data that until fairly recently was only accessible through manufacturer or developer data portals, decreasing their usability and portability into healthcare settings. Electronic health record data integration presents an exciting opportunity to simplify and streamline diabetes care into a single workflow. By incorporating these additional data sources into the patient's record, providers will have a more holistic view of the patient, which will enable more personalized treatment plans and more comprehensive documentation. However, there are several technical, operational, financial, and regulatory considerations for any data integration project. A relatively recent development, there are few standards for diabetes technology data, resulting in a variety of approaches that may inhibit diffusion and interoperability. This chapter will (1) explore a framework to understand the components required for successful diabetes technology data integration, (2) identify critical barriers to making progress in the field, and (3) propose solutions to deliver on the promise of digital diabetes care. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

One of the major bottlenecks of such silo systems is that they do not fully adhere to healthcare standards. This leads to inefficient utilization of such existing applications. The solution to such a problem is to design a new healthcare system that follows the existing standards. However, migrating the existing data to a newly designed system may not be easy due to its scale and nature. Alternatively, it may be possible to interconnect healthcare systems by bridging the existing data and data standards gap. With interoperability between the healthcare systems, a novel common data interface (CDI) layer is proposed.

In that later role, advanced by investments to counter the recent epidemic of opioid overdoses and the COVID-19 pandemic, public health decision support systems are beginning to have major impacts on the healthcare system. Public health decision support systems have many technically advanced features and use data integration, platform-independent implementations of decision-making logic, and advanced approaches for triggering of reporting of cases, based on national standards, to create tools to influence the health system. There is strong data to show the impacts of decision support systems on opioid prescribing and on uptake of vaccines (at a population level) and preliminary data on their value in decision making on vaccine administration at an individual level and for increased reporting of public health notifiable conditions. With deeper integration with electronic health record systems, based on the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource standards, and appropriate governmental policy backing, the ability for public health to influence the healthcare system through decision support techniques seems likely to increase over the next few years. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

By contrast, patient-directed decision support (support directed toward patients) has attracted less attention in the field. Patient-directed decision support involves supporting patients and their caregivers, with or without their care teams, in health-related decisions and actions. Information alone is not sufficient to support patient decisions: information about a decision must be accompanied by methods of eliciting patient values and preferences, guidance about how to apply values and preferences to decisions, and support for patient-provider shared decision making discussions. Technological solutions for patients include decision aids for one-time decisions and disease management systems for recurring disease-related decisions. All solutions for patients must consider technology access and literacy, self-efficacy for decision making, health literacy and numeracy, and implementation into workflow. Bringing informatics awareness to this important work could strengthen the field by ensuring that the tools patients need for decisions are grounded in the best evidence, developed with attention to patient needs and requirements, and (where appropriate) integrated into clinical systems, teams, and workflow. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

However, effectively managing and curating this data requires carefully designed workflows. While digitization and standardization enable continuous health monitoring, issues such as missing data values and technical glitches can jeopardize data consistency and timeliness. On the other hand, the Efficiency in processing the large volume of data from disparate sources generated by the healthcare industry is critical. In this chapter, we try to provide an overview of how distributed computing and Artificial Intelligence can be used in the context of smart healthcare and big data in practical use cases, enabling insights to improve patient care. In addition, we propose a workflow for developing prognostic models that uses the SMART BEAR infrastructure and leverages the capabilities of the Big Data Analytics engine to standardize and harmonize data. Our workflow improves data quality by evaluating different imputation algorithms and selecting the one that preserves the distribution and correlation of features similar to the original data. We applied this workflow to a subset of data in the SMART BEAR repository and evaluated its impact on predicting future health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and mild depression. We also explored the potential for model validation by clinicians in the SMART BEAR project, the transfer of subsequent actions within the decision support system, and the estimation of the required number of data points. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Analytics; Cloud computation; Internet of Things (IoT); Machine learning; Smart healthcare,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,,Book chapter,Final,,0,"no technological concepts, interoperability frameworks, or FHIR/SMART on FHIR standard",,,

This requiresmobile and desktop applications for patients and medical providers to obtain healthcare data from multiple HITs, which may be operating with different paradigms (e.g., cloud services, programming services, web services), use different cloud service providers, and employ different security/access control techniques. To address these issues, this chapter introduces and discusses an Access Control Framework for Secure and Interoperable Cloud Computing (FSICC) that provides a mechanism for multiple HITs to register cloud, programming, and web services and security requirements for use by applications. FSICC supports a global security policy and enforcement mechanism for cloud services with role-based (RBAC), discretionary (DAC), and mandatory (MAC) access controls. The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard models healthcare data using a set of 93 resources to track a patient's clinical findings, problems, etc. For each resource, an FHIR Application Program Interface (API) is defined to share data in a common format for each HIT that can be accessed by mobile applications. Thus, there is a need to support with a heterogeneous set of information sources and differing security protocols (i.e., RBAC, DAC, and MAC). To demonstrate the realization of FSICC, we apply the framework to the integration of the Connecticut Concussion Tracker (CT2) mHealth application with the OpenEMR electronic medical record utilizing FHIR. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",,,Springer Singapore,,,,Book chapter,Final,,1,,,,

Further, it has limited clinicians’ ability to customize EHRs in ways that improve care or workflows. Through a uniform, standards-based, public application programming interface, it is becoming possible to add connected apps to EHRs.

Real-time predictions provided by such models can aid physicians in interpreting the vast amount of patient data generated in the ICU. A huge percentage of electronic health record (EHR) data is generated through ICUs. Data for this study were extracted from MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care), a time-series database of intensive care unit (ICU) patient data. Applications of deep learning and nature-inspired algorithms for health care have evolved over the last few years. In this research, different deep-learning algorithms, such as long short-term memory (LSTM) and long short-term memory-attention (LSTM-AT), are investigated, using discharge notes and clinical and laboratory recordings, for hospital readmission and mortality prediction tasks. We have used explicit approaches for both the applications.

Many medical sensors like temperature, ECG, heartbeat, pressure measurement, and glucose sensor can be seen in sensing layer. Sensors measure the subject data and received data is transferred to doctor through layer known as server layer. Communication protocols are in the server layer, which helps in authorizing the data between devices and IoT in many fields. The need for the protocols is very important such as CoAP and MQTT, which is more compatible. The information that is transferred to the doctor will be sent to sensing layer which will be processed and stored. The IoT protocol made by researcher should be high efficient, energy consumption, suitable for data transfer like electronic health, and often operate on batteries, and the energy can be saved by using suitable protocol. © 2022 Scrivener Publishing LLC.",Architecture; CoAP; Data transfer; Digital healthcare system; IoMT; Medical sensors; MQTT; Protocols,,wiley,,,,Book chapter,Final,,0,"no technological concepts, interoperability frameworks, or FHIR/SMART on FHIR standard",,,

Use cases of application are rapidly expanding with the spread of the advancements described above. The applications can be categorized along with the patient care cycle from prevention, testing, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. The applications are mainly used in medical institutions, but they are also expanding outside of medical institutions, such as patients at home and remote patient monitoring.

Big data science, as it applies to precision medicine, is the generation and storage of large amounts of data from biospecimens, health records, medical imaging, and sensors from which disease-specific factors, patterns, and associations can be computationally identified and used to generate insights for clinical care, decision making, and treatment. In the broad sense, it includes electronic health records, biologic data (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics), environmental and lifestyle data, and data from wearable technology and mobile phone applications.

Despite its importance, it has not been consistently implemented in German university hospitals. In this paper we describe the approach of the German Medical Informatics Initiative (MII) towards the modelling of a medication core dataset using FHIR® profiles and standard-compliant terminologies. The FHIR profiles for Medication and MedicationStatement were adapted to the core dataset of the MIl. The terminologies to be used were selected based on the criteria of the ISO-standard for the Identification of Medicinal Products (IDMP). For a first use case with a minimal medication dataset, the entries in the medication chapter of the German Procedure Classification (OPS codes) were analyzed and mapped to IDMP-compliant medication terminology. OPS data are available at all German hospitals as they are mandatory for reimbursement purposes. Reimbursement-relevant encounter data containing OPS medication procedures were used to create a FHIR representation based on the FHIR profiles MedicationStatement and Medication. This minimal solution includes - besides the details on patient and start-/end-dates - the active ingredients identified by the IDMP-compliant codes and - if specified in the OPS code - the route of administration and the range of the amount of substance administered to the patient, using the appropriate unit of measurement code. With FHIR, the medication data can be represented in the data integration centers of the MII to provide a standardized format for data analysis across the MII sites. © 2021 The authors and IOS Press.",FHIR; Health Information Interoperability; Identification of Medicinal Products (IDMP); Medication,Electronic Health Records; Humans; Medical Informatics; Patient Compliance; electronic health record; human; medical informatics; patient compliance,IOS Press,,,,Book chapter,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,0,"no technological concepts, interoperability frameworks, or FHIR/SMART on FHIR standard",,,

With incredible development in data sciences, big data technologies, and embedded systems, today, it is possible to collect a huge amount of healthcare-related sensitive and personal data and store and compile it through cloud or edge computing scenarios. Sensor-based devices connected with the patient can capture body vitals like heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels, thus providing broader scope for remote patient monitoring of chronic or long-term conditions, tracking patient medication orders, and even tracking the mobility pattern and location of patients. Further, healthcare-related wearable devices can be configured to send emergency information to caregivers. When these IoMT-based devices are connected and configured with the patient healthcare monitoring system or hospital system, they are expected to provide effective assistance towards the decision-making process required for the treatment. This book chapter intends to discuss the basic concepts associated with IoMT and review the current state of the Internet of Things applied to healthcare and medical technologies and focus on an application based on IoMT. Recently, this field has seen exponential growth in terms of products and research at different levels, such as sensors, networks, and repositories. This chapter further focuses on application based on location tracking of movable healthcare base sensor devices, data acquisition from those devices, and efficient processing for decision-making.

Advances in smartphone software and hardware coupled with rising availability of wearable devices have resulted in exponential growth in the health apps market. Recent estimates suggest that more than 259,000 mHealth apps are available on app stores today and account for approximately 3.2 billion downloads annually. The evidence base supporting the use of apps independently of other interventions remains quite thin, and this has led to skepticism among large medical organizations about the role apps may play in healthcare. Nevertheless, apps continue to displace older technologies in several domains, for example, by replacing dedicated communication devices for individuals with autism and replacing medical bands with medical identification built into smartphone lock screens. Barriers such as privacy concerns and lack of integration into the electronic health record have limited the impact of apps, but mHealth has enormous potential to reshape healthcare delivery in the future. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The new requirements of the so-called eHealth Act mean that payment-driven and legal liability documentation will become increasingly medically dominated documentation. Additionally, patient data are no longer collected exclusively by physicians, but rather accumulated from many different sources. Patients are placed in the position of being able to document their data in their own patient records. Materials and methods: The requirements of medical documentation according to the German Code of Social Law (Sozialgesetzbuch, SGB) V were analyzed. The services of the systems for practice-based gynecologists and for gynecological departments in hospitals were summarized. Furthermore, a literature search was performed in PubMed and within the relevant journals for gynecology. Results: Since different organizations set different requirements for the content and technical aspects of medical and administrative applications and concepts, the documentation for the requirements is not only extensive, but also highly complicated and time consuming. Semantic interoperability is not given. Conclusion: The unclarified IT (information technology) situation in the German health care sector with respect to the IT standards to be applied faces all players with formidable challenges. Patients and medical staff are the persons affected. An all-encompassing e‑health strategy supported by all players including harmonization of the ensuing documentation is currently lacking. © 2018, Springer Verlag.

With increasing implementation of electronic health records (EHRs) and laboratory information systems worldwide, there is increasing demand for well-designed and evidence-based electronic resources. Both complex data-driven and simple interpretative electronic healthcare tools are currently available to improve the integration of clinical and laboratory information towards a more patient-centered approach to medicine. Several studies have reported positive clinical impact of electronic healthcare tool implementation in clinical laboratory diagnostics, including in the management of neonatal bilirubinemia, cardiac disease, and nutritional status. As patients have increasing access to their medical laboratory data, it is essential that accessible electronic healthcare tools are evidence-based and user-friendly for individuals of varying digital and medical literacy. Indeed, studies suggest electronic healthcare tool development processes significantly lack the involvement of relevant healthcare professionals and often present misinformation, including erroneous calculation algorithms or inappropriate interpretative recommendations. The current review provides an overview of the utility of available electronic healthcare tools in clinical laboratory diagnostics and critically reviews potential limitations and benefits of their clinical implementation.

Summary: Women are underrepresented in clinical trials and less likely to undergo DBS compared to their male counterparts. Racial and ethnic minorities are also less likely to undergo DBS procedures, even when controlling for disease severity and other demographic factors. These disparities can have significant impacts on patients' access to care, quality of life, and ability to manage their debilitating movement disorders. Key Messages: Addressing these disparities requires increasing patient awareness and education, minimizing barriers to equitable access, and implementing diversity and inclusion initiatives within the healthcare system. In this systematic review, we first review literature discussing gender, racial, and socioeconomic disparities in DBS access and then propose several patient, provider, community, and national-level interventions to improve DBS access for all populations. © 2024 The Author(s).

However, more and better wearable devices are being developed that can synchronize with these platforms to feed the information automatically. Another aspect that highlights the link between wearable devices and cloud-based health platforms is the improvement in which the symptomatology and/or physical status information of users can be stored and syn-chronized in real-time, 24 h a day, in health platforms, which in turn enables the possibility of synchronizing these platforms with specialized medical software to promptly detect important variations in user symptoms. This is opening opportunities to use these platforms as support for monitoring disease symptoms and, in general, for monitoring the health of users.

This scoping review systematically maps challenges and facilitators to longitudinal CDS that are applied at two or more timepoints for the same decision made by the same patient or clinician. Methods: We searched Embase, PubMed, and Medline databases for articles describing development, validation, or implementation of patient- or clinician-facing longitudinal CDS. Validated quality assessment tools were used for article selection. Challenges and facilitators to longitudinal CDS are reported according to PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Results: Eight articles met inclusion criteria; each article described a unique CDS. None used entirely automated data entry, none used living guidelines for updating the evidence base or knowledge engine as new evidence emerged during the longitudinal study, and one included formal readiness for change assessments. Seven of eight CDS were implemented and evaluated prospectively. Challenges were primarily related to suboptimal study design (with unique challenges for each study) or user interface. Facilitators included use of randomized trial designs for prospective enrollment, increased CDS uptake during longitudinal exposure, and machine-learning applications that are tailored to the CDS use case. Conclusions: Despite the intuitive advantages of representing healthcare decisions longitudinally, peer-reviewed literature on longitudinal CDS is sparse. Existing reports suggest opportunities to incorporate longitudinal CDS frameworks, automated data entry, living guidelines, and user readiness assessments. Generating best practice guidelines for longitudinal CDS would require a greater depth and breadth of published work and expert opinion. © The Author(s) 2024.",CDS; CDSS; evolve; healthcare; Shared decision-making,,SAGE Publications Inc.,,,,Review,Final,,0,"no technological concepts, interoperability frameworks, or FHIR/SMART on FHIR standard",,,

Standardized data and well-defined relationships between data points are necessary to guarantee semantic interoperability. Using the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard for clinical data representation would be a practical methodology to enhance and accelerate interoperability and data availability for research. Objective: This research aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art and current landscape in FHIR-based data models and structures. In addition, we intend to identify and discuss the tools, resources, limitations, and other critical aspects mentioned in the selected research papers. Methods: To ensure the extraction of reliable results, we followed the instructions of the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist. We analyzed the indexed articles in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, the ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar. After identifying, extracting, and assessing the quality and relevance of the articles, we synthesized the extracted data to identify common patterns, themes, and variations in the use of FHIR-based data models and structures across different studies. Results: On the basis of the reviewed articles, we could identify 2 main themes: dynamic (pipeline-based) and static data models. The articles were also categorized into health care use cases, including chronic diseases, COVID-19 and infectious diseases, cancer research, acute or intensive care, random and general medical notes, and other conditions. Furthermore, we summarized the important or common tools and approaches of the selected papers. These items included FHIR-based tools and frameworks, machine learning approaches, and data storage and security. The most common resource was “Observation” followed by “Condition” and “Patient.” The limitations and challenges of developing data models were categorized based on the issues of data integration, interoperability, standardization, performance, and scalability or generalizability. Conclusions: FHIR serves as a highly promising interoperability standard for developing real-world health care apps. The implementation of FHIR modeling for electronic health record data facilitates the integration, transmission, and analysis of data while also advancing translational research and phenotyping. Generally, FHIR-based exports of local data repositories improve data interoperability for systems and data warehouses across different settings. However, ongoing efforts to address existing limitations and challenges are essential for the successful implementation and integration of FHIR data models. ©Parinaz Tabari, Gennaro Costagliola, Mattia De Rosa, Martin Boeker.",data model; Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources; FHIR; interoperability; modeling; PRISMA,,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,1,,,,

Despite the increasing integration of information systems (ISs), research on their efficacy is conflicting. Drawing on related fields, we investigate how timing and mode of delivery influence IS effectiveness. Our objective is to reconcile previous contradictory findings, shedding light on optimal IS design in the ED. Materials and methods: We conducted a systematic review following PRISMA across PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. We coded the ISs’ timing as heuristic or analytical, their mode of delivery as active for automatic alerts and passive when requiring user-initiated information retrieval, and their effect on process, economic, and clinical outcomes. Results: Our analysis included 83 studies. During early heuristic decision-making, most active interventions were ineffective, while passive interventions generally improved outcomes. In the analytical phase, the effects were reversed. Passive interventions that facilitate information extraction consistently improved outcomes. Discussion: Our findings suggest that the effectiveness of active interventions negatively correlates with the amount of information received during delivery. During early heuristic decision-making, when information overload is high, physicians are unresponsive to alerts and proactively consult passive resources. In the later analytical phases, physicians show increased receptivity to alerts due to decreased diagnostic uncertainty and information quantity. Interventions that limit information lead to positive outcomes, supporting our interpretation. Conclusion: We synthesize our findings into an integrated model that reveals the underlying reasons for conflicting findings from previous reviews and can guide practitioners in designing ISs in the ED. © The Author(s) 2024.

In this regard, EHR can also provide several important advantages to omics research if the integration challenges are well handled. The main purpose of the present study was to review available and published knowledge in the related literature and then to classify and discuss stakeholders’ requirements in this domain. Material and Methods: At first, a broad electronic search of all available literature in English was conducted on the topic through a search in the databases of Medline, Web of Science, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Scopus, and Cochrane. Then, stakeholders’ requirements were tabulated, and finally, a word cloud was generated and analyzed to achieve functional and non-functional cases. Results: A total of 81 articles were included in the given analysis. Integration requirements also consisted of nine functional cases including a uniform approach to the interpretation of genetic tests, standardized terminologies and ontologies, structured data entry as much as possible, an integrated online patient portal, multiple data source handling, machine-readable storing and reporting, research-oriented requirements, pharmacogenomics decision support capabilities, and phenotyping algorithms and knowledge base. Besides, there were three non-functional cases comprised of interoperability of multiple systems, ethical, legal, security factor, and big data computations.

Despite recent uptake in AI research and adoption, the extent to which it improves quality, efficiency and equity of care beyond cancer diagnostics is uncertain to date. Henceforth, the objective of our systematic review is to assess the clinical readiness and deployability of AI through evaluation of prospective studies of AI in cancer care following diagnosis. We undertook a systematic review to determine the types of AI involved and their respective outcomes. A PubMed and Web of Science search between 1 January 2013 and 1 May 2023 identified 15 articles detailing prospective evaluation of AI in postdiagnostic cancer pathway. We appraised all studies using Risk of Bias Assessment of Randomised Controlled Trials and Risk of Bias In Non-randomised Studies-of Interventions quality assessment tools, as well as implementational analysis concerning time, cost and resource, to ascertain the quality of clinical evidence and real-world feasibility of AI. The results revealed that the majority of AI oncological research remained experimental without prospective clinical validation or deployment. Most studies failed to establish clinical validity and to translate measured AI efficacy into beneficial clinical outcomes. AI research are limited by lack of research standardisation and health system interoperability. Furthermore, implementational analysis and equity considerations of AI were largely missing. To overcome the triad of low-level clinical evidence, efficacy-outcome gap and incompatible research ecosystem for AI, future work should focus on multicollaborative AI implementation research designed and conducted in accordance with up-to-date research standards and local health systems.  © 2024 The Author(s).",chemotherapy; palliative care; radiation oncology; surgical oncology,,BMJ Publishing Group,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,0,"no technologica concept, reference implementation, software architecture",,,

Digital healthcare ecosystems emerge to target increasing healthcare costs and invest in standard Application Programming Interfaces (API), such as HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (HL7 FHIR) for trusted data flows. Objectives: This scoping review assessed the role and impact of HL7 FHIR and associated Implementation Guides (IGs) in digital healthcare ecosystems focusing on chronic disease management. Methods: To study trends and developments relevant to HL7 FHIR, a scoping review of the scientific and gray English literature from 2017 to 2023 was used. Results: The selection of 93 of 524 scientific papers reviewed in English indicates that the popularity of HL7 FHIR as a robust technical interface standard for the health sector has been steadily rising since its inception in 2010, reaching a peak in 2021. Digital Health applications use HL7 FHIR in cancer (45 %), cardiovascular disease (CVD) (more than 15 %), and diabetes (almost 15 %). The scoping review revealed that references to HL7 FHIR IGs are limited to ∼ 20 % of articles reviewed. HL7 FHIR R4 was most frequently referenced when the HL7 FHIR version was mentioned. In HL7 FHIR IGs registries and the internet, we found 35 HL7 FHIR IGs addressing chronic disease management, i.e., cancer (40 %), chronic disease management (25 %), and diabetes (20 %). HL7 FHIR IGs frequently complement the information in the article. Conclusions: HL7 FHIR matures with each revision of the standard as HL7 FHIR IGs are developed with validated data sets, common shared HL7 FHIR resources, and supporting tools. Referencing HL7 FHIR IGs cataloged in official registries and in scientific publications is recommended to advance data quality and facilitate mutual learning in growing digital healthcare ecosystems that nurture interoperability in digital health innovation. © 2024 The Authors",Chronic diseases; Digital healthcare ecosystems; Digital transformation; HL7 FHIR Implementation Guide; Interoperability standards; Living environments,Chronic Disease; Disease Management; Health Information Interoperability; Health Level Seven; Humans; Application programming interfaces (API); Diseases; Ecosystems; Health care; Chronic disease; Chronic disease management; Digital healthcare ecosystem; Digital transformation; Healthcare Interoperability; HL7 fast healthcare interoperability resource implementation guide; Implementation guides; Interoperability standard; Living environment; Scoping review; breast cancer; cancer research; cardiovascular disease; chronic disease; chronic lung disease; colorectal cancer; data interoperability; dementia; diabetes mellitus; Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources; grey literature; health care system; human; Internet; kidney disease; malignant neoplasm; multiple chronic conditions; ovary cancer; Parkinson disease; patient registry; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; Review; scientific literature; systematic review; uterine cervix cancer; chronic disease; data interoperability; disease management; health level 7; therapy; Interoperability,Elsevier Ireland Ltd,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,1,,,1.0,only once mentioned

Data, once directed by a patient to leave a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-covered health entity and enter a consumer app, will usually fall under Federal Trade Commission oversight. Because the statutory authority of the ONC does not extend to health data protection, there is not yet regulation to specifically address privacy protections for consumer apps. A technologically feasible workflow that could be widely adopted and permissible under ONC's rule, involves using the SMART on FHIR OAuth authorization routine to present standardized information about app behavior.

Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) is an open global standard that facilitates structuring of health information for coordinated exchange among stakeholders. Objective: The objective of this study is to design FHIR profiles and present methodology and the profiled FHIR resource for Maternal and Child Health referral use cases in Ebonyi state, Nigeria-a typical low- and middle-income country (LMIC) setting. Methods: Practicing doctors, midwives, and nurses were purposefully sampled and surveyed. Different referral forms were reviewed. The union of data sets from surveys and forms was aggregated and mapped to base patient FHIR resource elements, and extensions were created for data sets not in the core FHIR specification. This study also introduced FHIR and its relation to the World Health Organization's (WHO's) International Classification of Diseases. Results: We found many different data elements from the referral forms and survey responses even in urban settings. The resulting FHIR standard profile is published on GitHub for adaptation or adoption as necessary to aid alignment with WHO recommendations. Understanding data sets used in health care and clinical practice for information sharing is crucial in properly standardizing information sharing, particularly during the management of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. Development organizations and governments can use this methodology and profile to fast-track FHIR standards adoption for paper and electronic information sharing at PHC systems in LMICs. Conclusions: We presented our methodology for profiling the referral resource crucial for the standardized exchange of new and expectant moms' information.

However, possible unintended consequences during use, which can occur owing to low usability or the lack of adaption to existing workflows (eg, high cognitive load), may pose a challenge. To prevent this, the involvement of users in the development of EHRs is crucial and growing. Overall, involvement is designed to be very multifaceted, for example, in terms of the timing, frequency, or even methods used to capture user preferences. Objective: Setting, users and their needs, and the context and practice of health care must be considered in the design and subsequent implementation of EHRs. Many different approaches to user involvement exist, each requiring a variety of methodological choices. The aim of the study was to provide an overview of the existing forms of user involvement and the circumstances they need and to provide support for the planning of new involvement processes. Methods: We conducted a scoping review to provide a database for future projects on which design of inclusion is worthwhile and to show the diversity of reporting. Using a very broad search string, we searched the PubMed, CINAHL, and Scopus databases. In addition, we searched Google Scholar. Hits were screened according to scoping review methodology and then examined, focusing on methods and materials, participants, frequency and design of the development, and competencies of the researchers involved. Results: In total, 70 articles were included in the final analysis. There was a wide range of methods of involvement. Physicians and nurses were the most frequently included groups and, in most cases, were involved only once in the process. The approach of involvement (eg, co-design) was not specified in most of the studies (44/70, 63%). Further qualitative deficiencies in the reporting were evident in the presentation of the competences of members of the research and development teams. Think-aloud sessions, interviews, and prototypes were frequently used. Conclusions: This review provides insights into the diversity of health care professionals' involvement in the development of EHRs. It provides an overview of the different approaches in various fields of health care. However, it also shows the necessity of considering quality standards in the development of EHRs together with future users and the need for reporting this in future studies. © Theresa Sophie Busse, Chantal Jux, Johannes Laser, Peter Rasche, Horst Christian Vollmar, Jan P Ehlers, Sven Kernebeck.",digital technology; electronic health records; electronic medical records; stakeholder participation; technology development; user-centered design,,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,0,"no technologica concept, reference implementation, software architecture",,,

Intuitive practices for thromboprophylaxis have resulted in many patients being inappropriately prophylaxed. We conducted a narrative review summarizing system-wide thromboprophylaxis interventions in hospitalized patients. Multiple interventions for thromboprophylaxis have been tested, including multifaceted approaches such as national VTE prevention programs with audits, pre-printed order entry, passive alerts (either human or electronic), and more recently, the use of active clinical decision support (CDS) tools incorporated into electronic health records (EHRs). Multifaceted health-system and order entry interventions have shown mixed results in their ability to increase appropriate thromboprophylaxis and reduce VTE unless mandated through a national VTE prevention program, though the latter approach is potentially costly and effort- and time-dependent. Studies utilizing passive human or electronic alerts have also shown mixed results in increasing appropriate thromboprophylaxis and reducing VTE. Recently, a universal cloud-based and EHR-agnostic CDS VTE tool incorporating a validated VTE risk score revealed high adoption and effectiveness in increasing appropriate thromboprophylaxis and reducing major thromboembolism. Active CDS tools hold promise in improving appropriate thromboprophylaxis, especially with further refinement and widespread implementation within various EHRs and clinical workflows. © 2024 by the authors.",clinical decision support tools; electronic health records; hospitalized patients; thromboprophylaxis; venous thromboembolism,anticoagulant agent; enoxaparin; heparin; low molecular weight heparin; artery thrombosis; bleeding; checklist; clinical audit; clinical decision support system; cloud computing; consensus; data base; deep vein thrombosis; electronic health record; estimated glomerular filtration rate; evidence based medicine; evidence based practice; high risk patient; hospital patient; human; international normalized ratio; lung embolism; meta analysis (topic); mortality; observational study; pharmacist; physician; practice guideline; protocol compliance; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; risk; risk assessment; risk reduction; scoring system; software; surgical patient; systematic review (topic); thrombosis prevention; total quality management; venous thromboembolism; workflow,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,0,"no technologica concept, reference implementation, software architecture",,,

Materials and Methods: We used PubMed as our focus is applications of SDI in biomedical domains and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) to search and report for relevant studies published between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2021. We used Covidence—a systematic review management system—to carry out this scoping review. Results: The initial search from PubMed resulted in 5,326 articles using the two sets of keywords. We then removed 44 duplicates and 5,282 articles were retained for abstract screening. After abstract screening, we included 246 articles for full-text screening, among which 87 articles were deemed eligible for full-text extraction. We summarized the 87 articles from four aspects: (1) methods for the global schema; (2) data integration strategies (i.e., federated system vs. data warehousing); (3) the sources of the data; and (4) downstream applications. Conclusion: SDI approach can effectively resolve the semantic heterogeneities across different data sources. We identified two key gaps and challenges in existing SDI studies that (1) many of the existing SDI studies used data from only single-level data sources (e.g., integrating individual-level patient records from different hospital systems), and (2) documentation of the data integration processes is sparse, threatening the reproducibility of SDI studies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Common data element; Common data model; Ontology; Semantic data integration; Systematic review and meta-analyses (PRISMA) framework,Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Mass Screening; Reproducibility of Results; Semantics; Abstracting; Data warehouses; Health; Hospitals; Semantics; Common data element; Common data model; Common datum; Data elements; Meta-analysis; Ontology's; Semantic data; Semantic data integration; Systematic Review; Systematic review and meta-analyze (preferred reporting item for systematic review and meta-analyze) framework; adult; common data elements; data integration; data warehouse; documentation; extraction; female; hospital planning; human; male; medical record; Medline; ontology; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; reproducibility; review; systematic review; information retrieval; mass screening; semantics; Data integration,Elsevier Ireland Ltd,,,,Review,Final,,0,"no technological concepts, interoperability frameworks, or FHIR/SMART on FHIR standard",,,

85,85,Amar F.; April A.; Abran A.,Electronic Health Record and Semantic Issues Using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources: Systematic Mapping Review,2024,Journal of Medical Internet Research,3,10.2196/45209,"Background: The increasing use of electronic health records and the Internet of Things has led to interoperability issues at different levels (structural and semantic). Standards are important not only for successfully exchanging data but also for appropriately interpreting them (semantic interoperability). Thus, to facilitate the semantic interoperability of data exchanged in health care, considerable resources have been deployed to improve the quality of shared clinical data by structuring and mapping them to the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. Objective: The aims of this study are 2-fold: to inventory the studies on FHIR semantic interoperability resources and terminologies and to identify and classify the approaches and contributions proposed in these studies. Methods: A systematic mapping review (SMR) was conducted using 10 electronic databases as sources of information for inventory and review studies published during 2012 to 2022 on the development and improvement of semantic interoperability using the FHIR standard. Results: A total of 70 FHIR studies were selected and analyzed to identify FHIR resource types and terminologies from a semantic perspective. The proposed semantic approaches were classified into 6 categories, namely mapping (31/126, 24.6%), terminology services (18/126, 14.3%), resource description framework or web ontology language–based proposals (24/126, 19%), annotation proposals (18/126, 14.3%), machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) proposals (20/126, 15.9%), and ontology-based proposals (15/126, 11.9%). From 2012 to 2022, there has been continued research in 6 categories of approaches as well as in new and emerging annotations and ML and NLP proposals. This SMR also classifies the contributions of the selected studies into 5 categories: framework or architecture proposals, model proposals, technique proposals, comparison services, and tool proposals. The most frequent type of contribution is the proposal of a framework or architecture to enable semantic interoperability. Conclusions: This SMR provides a classification of the different solutions proposed to address semantic interoperability using FHIR at different levels: collecting, extracting and annotating data, modeling electronic health record data from legacy systems, and applying transformation and mapping to FHIR models and terminologies. The use of ML and NLP for unstructured data is promising and has been applied to specific use case scenarios. In addition, terminology services are needed to accelerate their use and adoption; furthermore, techniques and tools to automate annotation and ontology comparison should help reduce human interaction. ©Fouzia Amar, Alain April, Alain Abran.

This field guide attempts to clarify working definitions and conceptual boundaries within the lexicon of U.S. healthcare reform efforts that predated and have common thematic perspectives within the evolving VBH reform paradigm. Data Sources: Pubmed/MEDLINE/Google search. Review Methods: Pubmed/MEDLINE/Google search was performed during August 1, 2020-January14, 2021 for U.S. healthcare reform terms, legislative and government agency publications. Those citing relevant legislative, regulatory, philosophical and technological advancements integral to the development and function of VBH were catalogued according to the targeted stakeholders and evolving reform strategy or technology. Conclusions: Eight healthcare reform paradigms were identified as influential precursors to VBH: Patient-Centered Care Model, Patient-Centered Medical Home, Population Health, Personalized Medicine, P4 Medicine, Precision Medicine, Managed Care, and Accountable Care. Several of these models have similar nomenclature and, confusingly, many have multiple interpretations of the terms used to describe these models. However, consistent stakeholders identified within these paradigms are key to VBH; notably the patient, the physician and the payer (the “Big 3”). Demonstrable healthcare spending reductions have been best achieved when the Big 3 stakeholder interests are aligned within healthcare reform legislation.

Objectives: There is growing interest in the use of biomedical informatics and data analytics tools in spine surgery. Yet despite the rapid growth in research on these topics, few analytic tools have been implemented in routine spine practice. The purpose of this review is to provide a health information technology (HIT) roadmap to help translate data assets and analytics tools into measurable advances in spine surgical care. Methods: We conducted a narrative review of PubMed and Google Scholar to identify publications discussing data assets, analytical approaches, and implementation strategies relevant to spine surgery practice. Results: A variety of data assets are available for spine research, ranging from commonly used datasets, such as administrative billing data, to emerging resources, such as mobile health and biobanks. Both regression and machine learning techniques are valuable for analyzing these assets, and researchers should recognize the particular strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Few studies have focused on the implementation of HIT, and a variety of methods exist to help translate analytic tools into clinically useful interventions. Finally, a number of HIT-related challenges must be recognized and addressed, including stakeholder acceptance, regulatory oversight, and ethical considerations. Conclusions: Biomedical informatics has the potential to support the development of new HIT that can improve spine surgery quality and outcomes. By understanding the development life-cycle that includes identifying an appropriate data asset, selecting an analytic approach, and leveraging an effective implementation strategy, spine researchers can translate this potential into measurable advances in patient care. © The Author(s) 2021.",big data; spine surgery; biomedical informatics; data analytics; health information technology; implementation science; machine learning,adult; big data; biobank; female; human; implementation science; information science; language; life cycle; machine learning; male; medical information; Medline; narrative; patient care; review; search engine; spine surgery; systematic review,SAGE Publications Ltd,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,,,,,

As a result, there is a growing need to optimize healthcare IT to allow for the interoperable exchange of data. As a result, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT has implemented their Final Rule for the 21st Century Cures Act. This requires certified health IT systems to use modernized messaging standards for the safe and secure exchange of data within health information networks and also requires the use of terminology standards including LOINC, SNOMED CT, and UCUM for coding clinical and laboratory data. Given the critical importance of laboratory results in the delivery of healthcare, laboratorians must become familiar with these principles of interoperability.

In primary care, reduced SA among physicians increases errors in clinical decision-making and, correspondingly, patients’ risk of experiencing adverse outcomes. Our objective was to understand the extent to which electronic health records (EHRs) support primary care physicians (PCPs)’ SA during clinical decision-making. Method: We conducted a metanarrative review of papers in selected academic databases, including CINAHL and MEDLINE. Eligible studies included original peer-reviewed research published between January 2012 and August 2020 on PCP–EHR interactions. We iteratively queried, screened, and summarized literature focused on EHRs supporting PCPs’ clinical decision-making and care management for adults. Then, we mapped findings to an established SA framework to classify external factors (individual, task, and system) affecting PCPs’ levels of SA (1–Perception, 2–Comprehension, and 3–Projection) and identified SA barriers. Results: From 1504 articles identified, we included and synthesized 19 studies. Study designs were largely noninterventional. Studies described EHR workflow misalignments, usability issues, and communication challenges. EHR information, including lab results and care plans, was characterized as incomplete, untimely, or irrelevant. Unmet information needs made it difficult for PCPs to obtain even basic SA, Level 1 SA. Prevalent barriers to PCPs developing SA with EHRs were errant mental models, attentional tunneling, and data overload. Conclusion: Based on our review, EHRs do not support the development of higher levels of SA among PCPs. Review findings suggest SA-oriented design processes for health information technology could improve PCPs’ SA, satisfaction, and decision-making. © Copyright 2020, The Author(s).",cognition; decision-making; electronic health record; primary care; safety; situation awareness,"Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; Awareness; Communication; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Physicians, Primary Care; Behavioral research; eHealth; Iterative methods; Records management; Adverse outcomes; Clinical decision making; Cognition; Decisions makings; Dynamic environments; Electronic health; Electronic health record; Health records; Primary care; Situation awareness; adult; awareness; Cinahl; clinical decision making; cognitive model; comprehension; electronic health record; female; general practitioner; human; human experiment; male; medical information; Medline; perception; review; satisfaction; usability; workflow; awareness; electronic health record; health personnel attitude; interpersonal communication; Decision making",SAGE Publications Inc.,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,,,,,

The quickly evolving field of medical informatics research has contributed numerous concepts, algorithms, and standards to facilitate this development. However, these difficult relationships, complex terminologies, and multiple implementations can present obstacles for people who want to get active in the field. With a particular focus on medical informatics research conducted in Germany, we present in our Viewpoint a set of 10 important topics to improve the overall interdisciplinary communication between different stakeholders (eg, physicians, computational experts, experimentalists, students, patient representatives). This may lower the barriers to entry and offer a starting point for collaborations at different levels. The suggested topics are briefly introduced, then general best practice guidance is given, and further resources for in-depth reading or hands-on tutorials are recommended. In addition, the topics are set to cover current aspects and open research gaps of the medical informatics domain, including data regulations and concepts; data harmonization and processing; and data evaluation, visualization, and dissemination. In addition, we give an example on how these topics can be integrated in a medical informatics curriculum for higher education. By recognizing these topics, readers will be able to (1) set clinical and research data into the context of medical informatics, understanding what is possible to achieve with data or how data should be handled in terms of data privacy and storage; (2) distinguish current interoperability standards and obtain first insights into the processes leading to effective data transfer and analysis; and (3) value the use of newly developed technical approaches to utilize the full potential of clinical data. ©Markus Wolfien, Najia Ahmadi, Kai Fitzer, Sophia Grummt, Kilian-Ludwig Heine, Ian-C Jung, Dagmar Krefting, Andreas Kühn, Yuan Peng, Ines Reinecke, Julia Scheel, Tobias Schmidt, Paul Schmücker, Christina Schüttler, Dagmar Waltemath, Michele Zoch, Martin Sedlmayr.",clinical data; digital health; health informatics; interdisciplinary communication; medical informatics; research data,Algorithms; Curriculum; Germany; Humans; Medical Informatics; adult; curriculum; data privacy; Germany; human; interdisciplinary communication; medical informatics; nomenclature; physician; research gap; review; tertiary education; algorithm,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,,,,,

The DDI between warfarin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is common and potentially life-threatening. Patients can play a substantial role in preventing harm from DDIs; however, the current model for DDI decision-making is clinician centric. Objective: This study aims to design and study the usability of DDInteract, a tool to support shared decision-making (SDM) between a patient and provider for the DDI between warfarin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Methods: We used an SDM framework and user-centered design methods to guide the design and usability of DDInteract - an SDM electronic health record app to prevent harm from clinically significant DDIs. The design involved iterative prototypes, qualitative feedback from stakeholders, and a heuristic evaluation. The usability evaluation included patients and clinicians. Patients participated in a simulated SDM discussion using clinical vignettes. Clinicians were asked to complete eight tasks using DDInteract and to assess the tool using a survey adapted from the System Usability Scale. Results: The designed DDInteract prototype includes the following features: a patient-specific risk profile, dynamic risk icon array, patient education section, and treatment decision tree. A total of 4 patients and 11 clinicians participated in the usability study. After an SDM session where patients and clinicians review the tool concurrently, patients generally favored pain treatments with less risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Clinicians successfully completed the tasks with a mean of 144 (SD 74) seconds and rated the usability of DDInteract as 4.32 (SD 0.52) of 5. Conclusions: This study expands the use of SDM to DDIs. The next steps are to determine if DDInteract can improve shared decision-making quality and to implement it across health systems using interoperable technology.  ©Thomas J Reese, Guilherme Del Fiol, Keaton Morgan, Jason T Hurwitz, Kensaku Kawamoto, Ainhoa Gomez-Lumbreras, Mary L Brown, Henrik Thiess, Sara R Vazquez, Scott D Nelson, Richard Boyce, Daniel Malone.",Clinical decision support; Drug interaction; Shared decision-making; User-centered design,,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,,,,,
96,96,Yin R.; Law K.; Neyens D.,Examining how internet users trust and access electronic health record patient portals: Survey study,2021,JMIR Human Factors,5,10.2196/28501,"Background: Electronic health record (EHR) patient portals are designed to provide medical health records to patients. Using an EHR portal is expected to contribute to positive health outcomes and facilitate patient-provider communication. Objective: Our objective was to examine how portal users report using their portals and the factors associated with obtaining health information from the internet. We also examined the desired portal features, factors impacting users’ trust in portals, and barriers to using portals. Methods: An internet-based survey study was conducted using Amazon Mechanical Turk. All the participants were adults in the United States who used patient portals. The survey included questions about how the participants used their portals, what factors acted as barriers to using their portals, and how they used and how much they trusted other web-based health information sources as well as their portals. A logistic regression model was used to examine the factors influencing the participants’ trust in their portals. Additionally, the desired features and design characteristics were identified to support the design of future portals. Results: A total of 394 participants completed the survey. Most of the participants were less than 35 years old (212/394, 53.8%), with 36.3% (143/394) aged between 35 and 55 years, and 9.9% (39/394) aged above 55 years. Women accounted for 48.5% (191/394) of the survey participants. More than 78% (307/394) of the participants reported using portals at least monthly. The most common portal features used were viewing lab results, making appointments, and paying bills. Participants reported some barriers to portal use including data security and limited access to the internet. The results of a logistic regression model used to predict the trust in their portals suggest that those comfortable using their portals (odds ratio [OR] 7.97, 95% CI 1.11-57.32) thought that their portals were easy to use (OR 7.4, 95% CI 1.12-48.84), and frequent internet users (OR 43.72, 95% CI 1.83-1046.43) were more likely to trust their portals. Participants reporting that the portals were important in managing their health (OR 28.13, 95% CI 5.31-148.85) and that their portals were a valuable part of their health care (OR 6.75, 95% CI 1.51-30.11) were also more likely to trust their portals. Conclusions: There are several factors that impact the trust of EHR patient portal users in their portals. Designing easily usable portals and considering these factors may be the most effective approach to improving trust in patient portals. The desired features and usability of portals are critical factors that contribute to users’ trust in EHR portals. ©Rong Yin, Katherine Law, David Neyens.",Consumer health informatics; Electronic health records; Internet; Logistic model; Participatory medicine; Patient portal; Questionnaires; Surveys,,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,,,,,

However, most of these data are collected for clinical use rather than for retrospective analysis. This means that researchers typically face many different issues when attempting to access and prepare the data for secondary use. We aimed to investigate how raw EHRs can be accessed and prepared in retrospective data science projects in a disciplined, effective, and efficient way. We report our experience and findings from a large-scale data science project analyzing routinely acquired retrospective data from the Kepler University Hospital in Linz, Austria. The project involved data collection from more than 150,000 patients over a period of 10 years. It included diverse data modalities, such as static demographic data, irregularly acquired laboratory test results, regularly sampled vital signs, and high-frequency physiological waveform signals. Raw medical data can be corrupted in many unexpected ways that demand thorough manual inspection and highly individualized data cleaning solutions. We present a general data preparation workflow, which was shaped in the course of our project and consists of the following 7 steps: obtain a rough overview of the available EHR data, define clinically meaningful labels for supervised learning, extract relevant data from the hospital’s data warehouses, match data extracted from different sources, deidentify them, detect errors and inconsistencies therein through a careful exploratory analysis, and implement a suitable data processing pipeline in actual code. Only few of the data preparation issues encountered in our project were addressed by generic medical data preprocessing tools that have been proposed recently. Instead, highly individualized solutions for the specific data used in one’s own research seem inevitable. We believe that the proposed workflow can serve as a guidance for practitioners, helping them to identify and address potential problems early and avoid some common pitfalls. ©Alexander Maletzky, Carl Böck, Thomas Tschoellitsch, Theresa Roland, Helga Ludwig, Stefan Thumfart, Michael Giretzlehner, Sepp Hochreiter, Jens Meier.",electronic health record; machine learning; medical data preparation; retrospective data analysis,,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,,,,,

Although the clinical implications of AI in EHR systems have been extensively analyzed, its application in HIE as a crucial source of patient data is less explored. Addressing this gap, our systematic review delves into utilizing AI models in HIE, gauging their predictive prowess and potential limitations. Employing databases such as Scopus, CINAHL, Google Scholar, PubMed/Medline, and Web of Science and adhering to the PRISMA guidelines, we unearthed 1021 publications. Of these, 11 were shortlisted for the final analysis. A noticeable preference for machine learning models in prognosticating clinical results, notably in oncology and cardiac failures, was evident. The metrics displayed AUC values ranging between 61% and 99.91%. Sensitivity metrics spanned from 12% to 96.50%, specificity from 76.30% to 98.80%, positive predictive values varied from 83.70% to 94.10%, and negative predictive values between 94.10% and 99.10%. Despite variations in specific metrics, AI models drawing on HIE data unfailingly showcased commendable predictive proficiency in clinical verdicts, emphasizing the transformative potential of melding AI with HIE. However, variations in sensitivity highlight underlying challenges. As healthcare’s path becomes more enmeshed with AI, a well-rounded, enlightened approach is pivotal to guarantee the delivery of trustworthy and effective AI-augmented healthcare solutions. © 2023 by the authors.",artificial intelligence; electronic health record; health information exchange; machine learning,,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,,,,,
99,99,Nan J.; Xu L.-Q.,Designing Interoperable Health Care Services Based on Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources: Literature Review,2023,JMIR Medical Informatics,5,10.2196/44842,"Background: With the advent of the digital economy and the aging population, the demand for diversified health care services and innovative care delivery models has been overwhelming. This trend has accelerated the urgency to implement effective and efficient data exchange and service interoperability, which underpins coordinated care services among tiered health care institutions, improves the quality of oversight of regulators, and provides vast and comprehensive data collection to support clinical medicine and health economics research, thus improving the overall service quality and patient satisfaction. To meet this demand and facilitate the interoperability of IT systems of stakeholders, after years of preparation, Health Level 7 formally introduced, in 2014, the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. It has since continued to evolve. FHIR depends on the Implementation Guide (IG) to ensure feasibility and consistency while developing an interoperable health care service. The IG defines rules with associated documentation on how FHIR resources are used to tackle a particular problem. However, a gap remains between IGs and the process of building actual services because IGs are rules without specifying concrete methods, procedures, or tools. Thus, stakeholders may feel it nontrivial to participate in the ecosystem, giving rise to the need for a more actionable practice guideline (PG) for promoting FHIR’s fast adoption. Objective: This study aimed to propose a general FHIR PG to facilitate stakeholders in the health care ecosystem to understand FHIR and quickly develop interoperable health care services. Methods: We selected a collection of FHIR-related papers about the latest studies or use cases on designing and building FHIR-based interoperable health care services and tagged each use case as belonging to 1 of the 3 dominant innovation feature groups that are also associated with practice stages, that is, data standardization, data management, and data integration. Next, we reviewed each group’s detailed process and key techniques to build respective care services and collate a complete FHIR PG. Finally, as an example, we arbitrarily selected a use case outside the scope of the reviewed papers and mapped it back to the FHIR PG to demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of the PG. Results: The FHIR PG includes 2 core elements: one is a practice design that defines the responsibilities of stakeholders and outlines the complete procedure from data to services, and the other is a development architecture for practice design, which lists the available tools for each practice step and provides direct and actionable recommendations. Conclusions: The FHIR PG can bridge the gap between IGs and the process of building actual services by proposing actionable methods, procedures, and tools. It assists stakeholders in identifying participants’ roles, managing the scope of responsibilities, and developing relevant modules, thus helping promote FHIR-based interoperable health care services. © Jingwen Nan, Li-Qun Xu.","Health level 7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, HL7 FHIR; interoperability; literature review; mobile phone; practice guideline",,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,,,,,

However, patient safety officers and analysts in healthcare systems and safety organizations are challenged to make sense of the ever-increasing volume of PSE reports, including the free-text narratives. As a result, there is a growing emphasis on applying text mining and natural language processing (NLP) approaches to assist in the processing and understanding of these narratives. Although text mining and NLP in healthcare have advanced significantly over the past decades, the utility of the resulting models, ontologies, and algorithms to analyze PSE narratives are limited given the unique difference and challenges in content and language between PSE narratives and clinical documentation. To promote the application of text mining and NLP for PSE narratives, these unique challenges must be addressed. Improving data access, developing NLP resources to practically use contributing factor taxonomies, and developing and adopting shared specifications for interoperability will help create an infrastructure and environment that unlocks the collaborative potential between patient safety, research, and machine learning communities, in the development of reproducible and generalizable methods and models to better understand and improve patient safety and patient care.

Objectives of this study were, therefore, to (1) identify the proportion of randomized controlled trials with CDS interventions that were complex, (2) describe common gaps in the reporting of complexity in CDS research, and (3) determine the impact of increased complexity on CDS effectiveness. Materials and Methods: To assess CDS complexity and identify reporting gaps for characterizing CDS interventions, we used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses reporting tool for complex interventions. We evaluated the effect of increased complexity using random-effects meta-analysis. Results: Most included studies evaluated a complex CDS intervention (76%). No studies described use of analytical frameworks or causal pathways. Two studies discussed use of theory but only one fully described the rationale and put it in context of a behavior change. A small but positive effect (standardized mean difference, 0.147; 95% CI, 0.039-0.255; P <. 01) in favor of increasing intervention complexity was observed. Discussion: While most CDS studies should classify interventions as complex, opportunities persist for documenting and providing resources in a manner that would enable CDS interventions to be replicated and adapted. Unless reporting of the design, implementation, and evaluation of CDS interventions improves, only slight benefits can be expected. Conclusion: Conceptualizing CDS as complex interventions may help convey the careful attention that is needed to ensure these interventions are contextually and theoretically informed.  © 2022 The Author(s).

However, these data are frequently unavailable or present in a format that requires substantial revision. This article reports the results of a review of informatics literature published from 2010 to 2016 that addresses these issues by identifying categories of data content that might be included or revised in the EHR. Materials and Methods We used an iterative review process on 1,215 biomedical informatics research articles. We placed them into generic categories, reviewed and refined the categories, and then assigned additional articles, for a total of three iterations. Results Our process identified eight categories of data content issues: Adverse Events, Clinician Cognitive Processes, Data Standards Creation and Data Communication, Genomics, Medication List Data Capture, Patient Preferences, Patient-reported Data, and Phenotyping. Discussion These categories summarize discussions in biomedical informatics literature that concern data content issues restricting clinical informatics research. These barriers to research result from data that are either absent from the EHR or are inadequate (e.g., in narrative text form) for the downstream applications of the data. In light of these categories, we discuss changes to EHR data storage that should be considered in the redesign of EHRs, to promote continued innovation in clinical informatics.

With adoption of EHRs came the promise of improved efficiency, higher-quality care, and lower costs. Unfortunately, some clinicians are now spending twice as much time on documentation as they spend seeing patients, and the documentation paradigm of problem-oriented medical records is contributing to this imbalance. It is time to consider new innovations. The collaborative wiki format offers many opportunities to ease the burden of documentation as well as to increase the usefulness of the recorded clinical data. Wikis support multiple authorship, have built-in features to track edits and changes, allow for contextual linkages (e.g., linking medical problems to their treatment), and support new technologies such as application programming interfaces, which allow for safe and secure exchange of information. In this Perspective, the authors describe the rationale for considering this approach to clinical documentation and propose a pilot to learn about its effectiveness. They believe wiki-based documentation will become increasingly attractive, especially as new legislation and directives from policymakers seek to reduce the crushing documentation burden and as the U.S. health care system transitions from an episode-based payment structure to a value-based, outcomes-focused system.

In health care, we are experiencing a revolution in the use of sensors to collect data on patient behaviors and experiences. Yet, the potential of this data to transform health outcomes is being held back. Deficits in standards, lexicons, data rights, permissioning, and security have been well documented, less so the cultural adoption of sensor data integration as a priority for large-scale deployment and impact on patient lives. The use and reuse of trustworthy data to make better and faster decisions across drug development and care delivery will require an understanding of all stakeholder needs and best practices to ensure these needs are met.

Randomized controlled trials are the gold standard for drug development and performance evaluation. However, when the drug is applied outside the controlled environment, the outcomes may differ in patient populations. In this context, the need to understand the macro and micro changes involved in disease evolution and progression becomes important and so is the need for harvesting and harnessing the real-world data from various resources to use them in generating real-world evidence. Digital tools with potential relevance to rheumatology can potentially be leveraged to obtain greater patient insights, greater information on disease progression and disease micro processes and even in the early diagnosis of diseases. Since the patients spend only a minuscule portion of their time in hospital or in a clinic, using modern digital tools to generate realistic, bias-proof, real-world data in a non-invasive patient-friendly manner becomes critical. In this review we have appraised different digital mediums and mechanisms for collecting real-world data and proposed digital care models for generating real-world evidence in rheumatology. © 2021 The Author(s).

The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) data standard has been increasingly applied in developing these systems. However, methods for applying FHIR to ML-CISs are variable. Objective: This study evaluates and compares the functionalities, strengths, and weaknesses of existing systems and proposes guidelines for optimizing future work with ML-CISs. Methods: Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science were searched for articles describing machine learning systems that were used for clinical data analytics or decision support in compliance with FHIR standards. Information regarding each system’s functionality, data sources, formats, security, performance, resource requirements, scalability, strengths, and limitations was compared across systems. Results: A total of 39 articles describing FHIR-based ML-CISs were divided into the following three categories according to their primary focus: clinical decision support systems (n=18), data management and analytic platforms (n=10), or auxiliary modules and application programming interfaces (n=11). Model strengths included novel use of cloud systems, Bayesian networks, visualization strategies, and techniques for translating unstructured or free-text data to FHIR frameworks. Many intelligent systems lacked electronic health record interoperability and externally validated evidence of clinical efficacy. Conclusions: Shortcomings in current ML-CISs can be addressed by incorporating modular and interoperable data management, analytic platforms, secure interinstitutional data exchange, and application programming interfaces with adequate scalability to support both real-time and prospective clinical applications that use electronic health record platforms with diverse implementations. © 2023 The Author(s).",clinical decision support system; clinical informatics; decision support; Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources; FHIR; information systems; interoperability; interoperable; machine learning; ontologies; ontology; review methodology; review methods; scoping review,,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,,,,,

In Brazil, EHR development must follow specific standards, laws, and guidelines that contribute to implementing beneficial resources for population health monitoring. This paper presents an audit of the main approaches used for EHR development in Brazil, thus highlighting prospects, challenges, and existing gaps in the field. We applied a systematic review protocol to search for articles published from 2011 to 2021 in seven databases (Science Direct, Web of Science, PubMed, Springer, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and SciELO). Subsequently, we analyzed 14 articles that met the inclusion and quality criteria and answered our research questions. According to this analysis, 78.58% (11) of the articles state that interoperability between systems is essential for improving patient care. Moreover, many resources are being designed and deployed to achieve this communication between EHRs and other healthcare systems in the Brazilian landscape. Besides interoperability, the articles report other considerable elements: (i) the need for increased security with the deployment of permission resources for viewing patient data, (ii) the absence of accurate data for testing EHRs, and (iii) the relevance of defining a methodology for EHR development. Our review provides an overview of EHR development in Brazil and discusses current gaps, innovative approaches, and technological solutions that could potentially address the related challenges. Lastly, our study also addresses primary elements that could contribute to relevant components of EHR development in the context of Brazil's public health system.

However, it is also a box with (probably more than) seven locks: laboratories use their own internal coding systems, results are reported in different languages (four official languages plus English with very distinct features in Switzerland), report formats are not uniform, standard nomenclature (e.g. Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes [LOINC]) is not routinely used and even these coding systems lack important information, including data, for example, about the specific ""kit""used for testing or preanalytical procedures affecting the sample quality and result interpretability. Visualization of complex laboratory and reporting ""-omics""data are additional challenges. Currently, there is no ""passepartout""key for all these locks available, and also newer concepts such as Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR) might not provide enough plasticity to unconditionally render laboratory data interoperable.

This systematic review investigates the design, effectiveness, and economic outcomes of CDS targeting several common chronic diseases. Material and Methods: We conducted a search in PubMed (Medline), EBSCOHOST (CINAHL, APA PsychInfo, EconLit), and Web of Science. We limited the search to studies from 2011 to 2021. Studies were included if the CDS was electronic health record-based and targeted one or more of the following chronic diseases: cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. Studies with effectiveness or economic outcomes were considered for inclusion, and a meta-analysis was conducted. Results: The review included 76 studies with effectiveness outcomes and 9 with economic outcomes. Of the effectiveness studies, 63% described a positive outcome that favored the CDS intervention group. However, meta-analysis demonstrated that effect sizes were heterogenous and small, with limited clinical and statistical significance. Of the economic studies, most full economic evaluations (n = 5) used a modeled analysis approach. Cost-effectiveness of CDS varied widely between studies, with an estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ranging between USD$2192 to USD$151 955 per QALY. Conclusion: We summarize contemporary chronic disease CDS designs and evaluation results. The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness results for CDS interventions are highly heterogeneous, likely due to differences in implementation context and evaluation methodology. Improved quality of reporting, particularly from modeled economic evaluations, would assist decision makers to better interpret and utilize results from these primary research studies.

Wearable monitors and artificial intelligence–based decision support systems could be integrated with hospital-based digital health systems such as electronic health records (EHRs) to provide higher level care at a relatively low cost. However, the appropriate and sustainable application of these innovations in low- and middle-income countries requires an understanding of the local government’s requirements and regulations such as technology specifications, cybersecurity, data-sharing protocols, and interoperability. Objective: This scoping review aims to explore the current state of digital health research and the policies that govern the adoption of digital health systems in Vietnamese hospitals. Methods: We conducted a scoping review using a modification of the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. PubMed and Web of Science were searched for academic publications, and Th Vi n Pháp Lu t, a proprietary database of Vietnamese government documents, and the Vietnam Electronic Health Administration website were searched for government documents. Google Scholar and Google Search were used for snowballing searches. The sources were assessed against predefined eligibility criteria through title, abstract, and full-text screening. Relevant information from the included sources was charted and summarized. The review process was primarily undertaken by one researcher and reviewed by another researcher during each step. Results: In total, 11 academic publications and 20 government documents were included in this review. Among the academic studies, 5 reported engineering solutions for information systems in hospitals, 2 assessed readiness for EHR implementation, 1 tested physicians’ performance before and after using clinical decision support software, 1 reported a national laboratory information management system, and 2 reviewed the health system’s capability to implement eHealth and artificial intelligence. Of the 20 government documents, 19 were promulgated from 2013 to 2020. These regulations and guidance cover a wide range of digital health domains, including hospital information management systems, general and interoperability standards, cybersecurity in health organizations, conditions for the provision of health information technology (HIT), electronic health insurance claims, laboratory information systems, HIT maturity, digital health strategies, electronic medical records, EHRs, and eHealth architectural frameworks. Conclusions: Research about hospital-based digital health systems in Vietnam is very limited, particularly implementation studies. Government regulations and guidance for HIT in health care organizations have been released with increasing frequency since 2013, targeting a variety of information systems such as electronic medical records, EHRs, and laboratory information systems. In general, these policies were focused on the basic specifications and standards that digital health systems need to meet. More research is needed in the future to guide the implementation of digital health care systems in the Vietnam hospital setting. ©Duc Minh Tran, C Louise Thwaites, Jennifer Ilo Van Nuil, Jacob McKnight, An Phuoc Luu, Chris Paton",Administrative information; Compulsory; Data; Digital health; EHealth; Electronic medical records; Health; Health insurance ID; Hospital care; Mobile phone; Patient ID; Policy; Standards; Vietnam,"Artificial Intelligence; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Health Policy; Hospitals; Humans; Vietnam; artificial intelligence; computer security; decision support system; digital technology; electronic health record; electronic medical record; eligibility criteria; government regulation; health care organization; health care policy; health care system; health insurance; health program; hospital care; hospital information system; medical informatics; medical information system; medical research; Medline; physician; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; Review; search engine; telehealth; Viet Nam; Web of Science; artificial intelligence; clinical decision support system; health care policy; hospital; human; Viet Nam",JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,,,,,

Clinical decision support (CDS) refers to digital tools that present providers with clinically relevant information and recommendations, which have been shown to improve test utilization. Nevertheless, individual CDS applications often fail, and implementation remains challenging. CONTENT: We review common classes of CDS tools grounded in examples from the literature as well as our own institutional experience. In addition, we present a practical framework and specific recommendations for effective CDS implementation.

However, AI tools have not yet been widely successful. One of the key reason is the COVID-19 pandemic has demanded faster real-time development of AI-driven clinical and health support tools, including rapid data collection, algorithm development, validation, and deployment. However, there was not enough time for proper data quality control. Learning from the hard lessons in COVID-19, we summarize the important health data quality challenges during COVID-19 pandemic such as lack of data standardization, missing data, tabulation errors, and noise and artifact. Then we conduct a systematic investigation of computational methods that address these issues, including emerging novel advanced AI data quality control methods that achieve better data quality outcomes and, in some cases, simplify or automate the data cleaning process.

In designing RCTs of EHR interventions, one should carefully consider the unit of randomization (for example, patient, encounter, clinician, or clinical unit), balancing concerns about contamination of an intervention across randomization units within clusters (for example, patients within clinical units) against the superior control of measured and unmeasured confounders that comes with randomizing a larger number of units. One should also consider whether the key computational assessment components of the EHR intervention, such as a predictive algorithm used to target a subgroup for decision support, should occur before randomization (so that only 1 subgroup is randomized) or after randomization (including all subgroups). When these components are applied after randomization, one must consider expected heterogeneity in the effect of the differential decision support across subgroups, which has implications for overall impact potential, analytic approach, and sample size planning. Trials of EHR interventions should be reviewed by an institutional review board, but may not require patient-level informed consent when the interventions being tested can be considered minimal risk or quality improvement, and when clinical decision making is supported, rather than controlled, by an EHR intervention. Data and safety monitoring for RCTs of EHR interventions should be conducted to guide institutional pragmatic decision making about implementation and ensure that continuing randomization remains justified. Reporting should follow the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) Statement, with extensions for pragmatic trials and cluster RCTs when applicable, and should include detailed materials to enhance reproducibility. © 2020 American College of Physicians.

EC diagnosed at advanced stages shows a poor therapeutic response. The clinically utilized EC diagnostic approaches are costly, time-consuming, and are not readily available to all patients. The rapid growth in computational biology has enticed substantial research attention from both data scientists and oncologists, leading to the development of rapid and cost-effective computer-aided cancer surveillance systems. Machine learning (ML), a subcategory of artificial intelligence, provides opportunities for drug discovery, early cancer diagnosis, effective treatment, and choice of treatment modalities. The application of ML approaches in EC diagnosis, therapies, and prognosis may be particularly relevant. Considering the significance of customized treatment and the growing trend of using ML approaches in cancer prediction and monitoring, a critical survey of ML utility in EC may provide impetus research in EC and assist oncologists, molecular biologists, biomedical engineers, and bioinformaticians to further collaborative research in EC. In this review, an overview of EC along with risk factors and diagnostic methods is discussed, followed by a comprehensive analysis of the potential ML modalities for prevention, screening, detection, and prognosis of EC patients.

Despite increased availability of electronic health records and the ongoing development of new CDS technologies, uptake of CDS into routine clinical settings is inconsistent. This qualitative systematic review seeks to synthesise healthcare provider experiences of CDS—exploring the barriers and enablers to implementing, using, evaluating, and sustaining chronic disease CDS systems. Methods: A search was conducted in Medline, CINAHL, APA PsychInfo, EconLit, and Web of Science from 2011 to 2021. Primary research studies incorporating qualitative findings were included if they targeted healthcare providers and studied a relevant chronic disease CDS intervention. Relevant CDS interventions were electronic health record-based and addressed one or more of the following chronic diseases: cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and hypercholesterolaemia. Qualitative findings were synthesised using a meta-aggregative approach. Results: Thirty-three primary research articles were included in this qualitative systematic review. Meta-aggregation of qualitative data revealed 177 findings and 29 categories, which were aggregated into 8 synthesised findings. The synthesised findings related to clinical context, user, external context, and technical factors affecting CDS uptake. Key barriers to uptake included CDS systems that were simplistic, had limited clinical applicability in multimorbidity, and integrated poorly into existing workflows. Enablers to successful CDS interventions included perceived usefulness in providing relevant clinical knowledge and structured chronic disease care; user confidence gained through training and post training follow-up; external contexts comprised of strong clinical champions, allocated personnel, and technical support; and CDS technical features that are both highly functional, and attractive. Conclusion: This systematic review explored healthcare provider experiences, focussing on barriers and enablers to CDS use for chronic diseases. The results provide an evidence-base for designing, implementing, and sustaining future CDS systems. Based on the findings from this review, we highlight actionable steps for practice and future research.

EHR trajectories, the temporal aspect of health records, facilitate predicting patients’ future health-related risks. It enables healthcare systems to increase the quality of care through early identification and primary prevention. Deep learning techniques have shown great capacity for analyzing complex data and have been successful for prediction tasks using complex EHR trajectories. This systematic review aims to analyze recent studies to identify challenges, knowledge gaps, and ongoing research directions. Methods: For this systematic review, we searched Scopus, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and ACM databases from Jan 2016 to April 2022 using search terms centered around EHR, deep learning, and trajectories. Then the selected papers were analyzed according to publication characteristics, objectives, and their solutions regarding existing challenges, such as the model's capacity to deal with intricate data dependencies, data insufficiency, and explainability. Results: : After removing duplicates and out-of-scope papers, 63 papers were selected, which showed rapid growth in the number of research in recent years. Predicting all diseases in the next visit and the onset of cardiovascular diseases were the most common targets. Different contextual and non-contextual representation learning methods are employed to retrieve important information from the sequence of EHR trajectories. Recurrent neural networks and the time-aware attention mechanism for modeling long-term dependencies, self-attentions, convolutional neural networks, graphs for representing inner visit relations, and attention scores for explainability were frequently used among the reviewed publications. Conclusions: This systematic review demonstrated how recent breakthroughs in deep learning methods have facilitated the modeling of EHR trajectories. Research on improving the ability of graph neural networks, attention mechanisms, and cross-modal learning to analyze intricate dependencies among EHRs has shown good progress. There is a need to increase the number of publicly available EHR trajectory datasets to allow for easier comparison among different models. Also, very few developed models can handle all aspects of EHR trajectory data. © 2023 The Author(s)",Deep learning; Disease prediction; EHR trajectories; Electronic health records; Systematic review,"Cardiovascular Diseases; Deep Learning; Electronic Health Records; Forecasting; Humans; Neural Networks, Computer; Complex networks; E-learning; Forecasting; Health risks; Learning systems; Paper; Records management; Recurrent neural networks; Deep learning; Disease prediction; Electronic health; Electronic health record; Electronic health record trajectory; Health records; Learning methods; Systematic Review; analytical parameters; cardiovascular disease; convolutional neural network; cross modal learning; data dependency; data explainability; data insufficiency; deep learning; electronic health record; human; knowledge gap; learning; predictive model; publication; recurrent neural network; Review; systematic review; artificial neural network; cardiovascular disease; electronic health record; forecasting; Trajectories",Academic Press Inc.,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,,,,,

Patient-centered care is gaining international acceptance with the patient taking greater responsibility for his/her health and sharing decision making for the diagnosis and management of illness. Laboratory medicine must embrace this change and work in a tripartite collaboration with patients and with the clinicians who use clinical laboratory services. Improved communication is the key to participation, including the provision of educational information and support. Knowledge management should be targeted to each stakeholder group. As part of collaborative healthcare clinical laboratory service provision needs to be more flexible and available, with implications for managers who oversee the structure and governance of the service. Increased use of managed point of care testing will be essential.

Over the past 35 years, the number of cardiovascular registries has skyrocketed, and their use will only continue to grow as data on novel procedures and devices will need to be collected and analyzed. The American College of Cardiology and Society of Thoracic Surgeons Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry is just one example of a modern registry that plays a crucial role in collecting data on patients undergoing transcatheter valvular procedures. Through public reporting registries, data can be shared on a hospital and provider level for many quality performance measures. There remains much work to be done on allowing automated data extraction from the electronic medical record directly into registries. No matter how sophisticated and complete a registry is, it can never overcome the problem of treatment selection bias that is inherent in observational data.

As it progresses, patients become increasingly dependent, and their caregivers are burdened with the increasing demand for managing their care. Mobile health (mHealth) technology, such as smartphone applications, can support the need of these caregivers. This paper examines the published academic literature of mHealth applications that support the caregivers of AD patients. Following the PRISMA for scoping reviews, we searched published literature in five electronic databases between January 2014 and January 2021. Twelve articles were included in the final review. Six themes emerged based on the functionalities provided by the reviewed applications for caregivers. They are tracking, task management, monitoring, caregiver mental support, education, and caregiver communication platform. The review revealed that mHealth applications for AD patients’ caregivers are inadequate. There is an opportunity for industry, government, and academia to fill the unmet need of these caregiver. © 2021, The Author(s).",,Neurodegenerative diseases; Academic literature; Alzheimer; Chronic disease; Electronic database; Health technology; Mobile health application; Neurodegenerative; Scoping review; Smart-phone applications; Task management; Alzheimer disease; caregiver; caregiver burden; education; empowerment; human; interpersonal communication; mental health; monitoring; patient care; Review; mHealth,Nature Research,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,,,,,

More convenient, less invasive monitoring devices, including patches, wearables, and biosensors, now allow for continuous physiological data to be gleaned from patients in a variety of care settings across the perioperative experience. These data can be bound into a single data repository, creating so-called data lakes. The high volume and diversity of data in these repositories must be processed into standard formats that can be queried in real time. These data can then be used by sophisticated prediction algorithms currently under development, enabling the early recognition of patterns of clinical deterioration otherwise undetectable to humans. Improved predictions can reduce alarm fatigue. In addition, data are now automatically queriable on a real-time basis such that they can be fed back to clinicians in a time frame that allows for meaningful intervention. These advancements are key components of successful remote surveillance systems. Anesthesiologists have the opportunity to be at the forefront of remote surveillance in the care they provide in the operating room, postanesthesia care unit, and intensive care unit, while also expanding their scope to include high-risk preoperative and postoperative patients on the general care wards. These systems hold the promise of enabling anesthesiologists to detect and intervene upon changes in the clinical status of the patient before adverse events have occurred. Importantly, however, significant barriers still exist to the effective deployment of these technologies and their study in impacting patient outcomes. Studies demonstrating the impact of remote surveillance on patient outcomes are limited. Critical to the impact of the technology are strategies of implementation, including who should receive and respond to alerts and how they should respond. Moreover, the lack of cost-effectiveness data and the uncertainty of whether clinical activities surrounding these technologies will be financially reimbursed remain significant challenges to future scale and sustainability. This narrative review will discuss the evolving technical components of remote surveillance systems, the clinical use cases relevant to the anesthesiologist's practice, the existing evidence for their impact on patients, the barriers that exist to their effective implementation and study, and important considerations regarding sustainability and cost-effectiveness. © 2019 International Anesthesia Research Society.",,Anesthesiology; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Data Management; Humans; Medical Informatics; Quality of Health Care; Remote Sensing Technology; Time Factors; anesthesiologist; cost effectiveness analysis; electronic health record; human; intensive care unit; patient right; postoperative care; prediction; preoperative evaluation; priority journal; recovery room; Review; treatment outcome; ward; anesthesiology; cost benefit analysis; economics; health care quality; information processing; medical informatics; procedures; remote sensing; time factor,Lippincott Williams and Wilkins,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,0,"no technological concepts, interoperability frameworks, or FHIR/SMART on FHIR standard",,,

Since the introduction of this new type of information in EHRs is relatively new (for instance, the widespread adoption of EHRs in the United States is just about a decade old), it is not surprising that a myriad of approaches has been attempted, with various degrees of success. EHR systems undergo much customization to fit the needs of health systems; these approaches have been varied and not always generalizable. The intent of this article is to present a high-level view of these approaches, emphasizing the functionality that they are trying to achieve, and not to advocate for specific solutions, which may become obsolete soon after this review is published. We start by broadly defining the end goal of including genomics in EHRs for healthcare and then explaining the various sources of information that need to be linked to arrive at a clinically actionable genomics analysis using a pharmacogenomics example.

Although community pharmacists are highly accessible to patients and possess robust clinical knowledge, they are limited in the clinical services they can provide owing to their lack of access to patient health records. We proposed a blockchain- and AI-based conceptual framework by performing a scoping review of successful blockchain integration in health systems. Objective: To formulate a conceptual framework based on a scoping review to improve access to health care data in the community pharmacy setting through the adoption of blockchain technology and AI. Methods: We performed a scoping review of literature based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses review criteria to identify the specific areas where blockchain can be implemented in health systems. We utilized the Pharmacists’ Patient Care Process (PPCP) to identify 2 critical areas for blockchain integration that can support community pharmacists to access patient electronic health records and implement patient-specific information in clinical decision-making. Results: We included 7 articles out of 70 articles in our final review. The 2 areas in the PPCP identified for the use of blockchain on the basis of the literature review were “Assess” and “Implement.” Our proposed model involves pharmacists using AI and blockchain technology to comprehensively assess any concerns with the prescribed medication through access to laboratory results for patients and then implement a plan based on a comprehensive assessment of the patient's health record. Conclusions: Utilizing blockchain to securely share health data with community pharmacies has the potential to improve patient outcomes, optimize medication safety, and amplify pharmacists’ roles in patient care.

Furthermore, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches for supporting clinical research and support is increasing. However, AI and ML applications for precision dosing have been evaluated only recently. Given the capability of ML to handle multidimensional data, such as from electronic health records, opportunities for AI and ML applications to facilitate TDM and MIPD may be advantageous.Methods:This review summarizes relevant AI and ML approaches to support TDM and MIPD, with a specific focus on recent applications. The opportunities and challenges associated with this integration are also discussed.Results:Various AI and ML applications have been evaluated for precision dosing, including those related to concentration or exposure prediction, dose optimization, population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, quantitative systems pharmacology, and MIPD system development and support. These applications provide an opportunity for ML and pharmacometrics to operate in an integrated manner to provide clinical decision support for precision dosing.Conclusions:Although the integration of AI with precision dosing is still in its early stages and is evolving, AI and ML have the potential to work harmoniously and synergistically with pharmacometric approaches to support TDM and MIPD. Because data are increasingly shared between institutions and clinical networks and aggregated into large databases, these applications will continue to grow. The successful implementation of these approaches will depend on cross-field collaborations among clinicians and experts in informatics, ML, pharmacometrics, clinical pharmacology, and TDM. © The Author(s), 2022.

We conducted a systematic review including experimental and quasi-experimental studies of information display interventions conducted in critical care and anesthesiology settings. Citations from January 1990 to June 2018 were searched in PubMed and IEEE Xplore. Reviewers worked independently to screen articles, evaluate quality, and abstract primary outcomes and display features. Results. Of 6742 studies identified, 22 studies evaluating 17 information displays met the study inclusion criteria. Information display categories included comprehensive integrated displays (3 displays), multipatient dashboards (7 displays), physiologic and laboratory monitoring (5 displays), and expert systems (2 displays). Significant improvement on primary outcomes over usual care was reported in 12 studies for 9 unique displays. Improvement was found mostly with comprehensive integrated displays (4 of 6 studies) and multipatient dashboards (5 of 7 studies). Only 1 of 5 randomized controlled trials had a positive effect in the primary outcome. Conclusion. We found weak evidence suggesting comprehensive integrated displays improve provider efficiency and process outcomes, and multipatient dashboards improve compliance with care protocols and patient outcomes. Randomized controlled trials of physiologic and laboratory monitoring displays did not show improvement in primary outcomes, despite positive results in simulated settings.

Method Literature review. Results Three hundred and twelve potential articles were identified on initial search, of which 117 were relevant and included in the review. Several factors were related to implementation success, such as good leadership and management, infrastructure support, staff training and focus on workflows and usability. In general, EPR implementation is associated with improvements in documentation and screening performance and reduced prescribing errors, whereas there are minimal available data in other areas such as effects on clinical patient outcomes. The peer-reviewed literature appears to under-represent a range of technical factors important for EPR implementations, such as data migration from existing systems and impact of organisational readiness. Conclusion The findings presented here represent the synthesis of data from peer-reviewed literature in the field and should be of value to provide the evidencebase for organisations considering how best to implement an EPR system.

138,138,Cox C.E.; Randall Curtis J.,Using technology to create a more humanistic approach to integrating palliative care into the intensive care unit C,2016,American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,28,10.1164/rccm.201508-1628CP,"A decade ago, the major obstacles to integration of palliative care into the intensive care unit (ICU) were the limited number of providers trained in palliative care, an immature evidence base, and a lack of appreciation for the importance of palliative care in the ICU. In 2016, the palliative care workforce has expanded markedly and there is growing appreciation of the benefits of palliative care, whether provided by a generalist (intensivist, nurse, social worker) or palliative care specialist. However, there is evidence that the quality of ICU-based palliative care is often suboptimal. A major barrier to more broadly addressing this quality problem is the lack of scalable ICU-based palliative care models that use technology to deliver efficient, collaborative palliative care in the ICU setting to the right patient at the right time. To address these challenges, we first review strengths and limitations of current care models as the basis for our novel conceptual framework that uses the electronic health record as a platform on which external innovations can be built, including: (1) screening for patients at risk for poor outcomes, (2) integrating patient- and family-reported needs, (3) personalizing care, and (4) directing generalist versus specialist triage algorithms. In the approaches considered, we describe current challenges and propose specific solutions that use technology to improve the quality of the human interaction in a stressful, complex environment. © 2016 by the American Thoracic Society.",Critical illness; Palliative care; Patient centeredness; Patient-reported outcomes,Algorithms; Biomedical Technology; Critical Illness; Electronic Health Records; Health Manpower; Intensive Care Units; Palliative Care; Patient-Centered Care; Prognosis; Triage; conceptual framework; critically ill patient; distress syndrome; electronic health record; emergency health service; family; health care quality; human; humanism; integrative medicine; intensive care unit; interpersonal communication; length of stay; medical specialist; medical technology; needs assessment; palliative therapy; patient care; patient risk; patient-reported outcome; priority journal; prognosis; quality of life; Review; screening; terminal care; algorithm; critical illness; electronic health record; health care manpower; intensive care unit; manpower; medical technology; organization and management; palliative therapy,American Thoracic Society,,,,Review,Final,,0,"no technological concepts, interoperability frameworks, or FHIR/SMART on FHIR standard",,,

Digital health technologies can support the delivery of personalised nutrition care through the standardised Nutrition Care Process (NCP) by using personal data and technology-supported delivery modalities. The digital disruption of traditional dietetic services is occurring worldwide, supporting responsive and high-quality nutrition care. These disruptive technologies include integrated electronic and personal health records, mobile apps, wearables, artificial intelligence and machine learning, conversation agents, chatbots, and social robots. Here, we outline how digital health is disrupting the traditional model of nutrition care delivery and outline the potential for dietitians to not only embrace digital disruption, but also take ownership in shaping it, aiming to enhance patient care. An overview is provided of digital health concepts and disruptive technologies according to the four steps in the NCP: nutrition assessment, diagnosis, intervention, and monitoring and evaluation. It is imperative that dietitians stay abreast of these technological developments and be the leaders of the disruption, not simply subject to it.

Data sharing in precision oncology is therefore of utmost importance. The Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) Data Principles have been developed to define good practices in data sharing. Motivated by the ambition of applying the FAIR Data Principles to our own clinical precision oncology implementations and research, we have performed a systematic literature review of potentially relevant initiatives. For clinical data, we suggest using the Genomic Data Commons model as a reference as it provides a field-tested and well-documented solution. Regarding classification of diagnosis, morphology and topography and drugs, we chose to follow the World Health Organization standards, i.e. ICD10, ICD-O-3 and Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classifications, respectively. For the bioinformatics pipeline, the Genome Analysis ToolKit Best Practices using Docker containers offer a coherent solution and have therefore been selected. Regarding the naming of variants, we follow the Human Genome Variation Society's standard.

We conducted a scoping review to identify trends and gaps in the use of FHIR for clinical research. Materials and methods: We reviewed published literature, federally funded project databases, application websites, and other sources to discover FHIR-based papers, projects, and tools (collectively, ""FHIR projects"") available to support clinical research activities. Results: Our search identified 203 different FHIR projects applicable to clinical research. Most were associated with preparations to conduct research, such as data mapping to and from FHIR formats (n = 66, 32.5%) and managing ontologies with FHIR (n = 30, 14.8%), or post-study data activities, such as sharing data using repositories or registries (n = 24, 11.8%), general research data sharing (n = 23, 11.3%), and management of genomic data (n = 21, 10.3%). With the exception of phenotyping (n = 19, 9.4%), fewer FHIR-based projects focused on needs within the clinical research process itself. Discussion: Funding and usage of FHIR-enabled solutions for research are expanding, but most projects appear focused on establishing data pipelines and linking clinical systems such as electronic health records, patient-facing data systems, and registries, possibly due to the relative newness of FHIR and the incentives for FHIR integration in health information systems. Fewer FHIR projects were associated with research-only activities. Conclusion: The FHIR standard is becoming an essential component of the clinical research enterprise. To develop FHIR's full potential for clinical research, funding and operational stakeholders should address gaps in FHIR-based research tools and methods.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Digital patient-reported symptoms collected between visits can inform these, especially if integrated into electronic health records (EHRs) and clinical workflows. This systematic review identified and summarized EHR-integrated systems to remotely collect patient-reported symptoms and examined their anticipated and realized benefits in long-term conditions. Materials and Methods: We searched Medline, Web of Science, and Embase. Inclusion criteria were symptom reporting systems in adults with long-term conditions; data integrated into the EHR; data collection outside of clinic; data used in clinical care. We synthesized data thematically. Benefits were assessed against a list of outcome indicators. We critically appraised studies using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Results: We included 12 studies representing 10 systems. Seven were in oncology. Systems were technically and functionally heterogeneous, with the majority being fully integrated (data viewable in the EHR). Half of the systems enabled regular symptom tracking between visits. We identified 3 symptom report-guided clinical workflows: Consultation-only (data used during consultation, n = 5), alert-based (real-time alerts for providers, n = 4) and patient-initiated visits (n = 1). Few author-described anticipated benefits, primarily to improve communication and resultant health outcomes, were realized based on the study results, and were only supported by evidence from early-stage qualitative studies. Studies were primarily feasibility and pilot studies of acceptable quality. Discussion and Conclusions: EHR-integrated remote symptom monitoring is possible, but there are few published efforts to inform development of these systems. Currently there is limited evidence that this improves care and outcomes, warranting future robust, quantitative studies of efficacy and effectiveness.  © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

This use of artificial intelligence models in clinical decision support (AI-CDS) may have several advantages over traditional “rule-based” CDS models in pediatric care through increased model accuracy, with fewer false alerts and missed patients. AI-CDS tools must be appropriately developed, provide insight into the rationale behind decisions, be seamlessly integrated into care pathways, be intuitive to use, answer clinically relevant questions, respect the content expertise of the healthcare provider, and be scientifically sound. While numerous machine learning models have been reported in pediatric care, their integration into AI-CDS remains incompletely realized to date. Important challenges in the application of AI models in pediatric care include the relatively lower rates of clinically significant outcomes compared to adults, and the lack of sufficiently large datasets available necessary for the development of machine learning models. In this review article, we summarize key concepts related to AI-CDS, its current application to pediatric care, and its potential benefits and risks. Impact: The performance of clinical decision support may be enhanced by the utilization of machine learning-based algorithms to improve the predictive performance of underlying models.Artificial intelligence-based clinical decision support (AI-CDS) uses models that are experientially improved through training and are particularly well suited toward high-dimensional data.The application of AI-CDS toward pediatric care remains limited currently but represents an important area of future research. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to the International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.",,"Adult; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Child; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Humans; Machine Learning; Software; adult; algorithm; artificial intelligence; child; clinical decision support system; deterioration; health care personnel; human; machine learning; pediatrics; review; sound; algorithm; machine learning; software",Springer Nature,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,0,"no technological concepts, interoperability frameworks, or FHIR/SMART on FHIR standard",,,

Even with the increase in availability and use of mHealth apps, there has still not been a lot of research into understanding the intention to use this kind of apps. Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate a technology acceptance model (TAM) that has been specially designed for primary health care applications. Methods: The proposed model is an extension of the TAM, and was empirically tested using data obtained from a survey of mHealth app users (n=310). The research analyzed 2 additional external factors: promotion of health and health benefits. Data were analyzed with a PLS-SEM software and confirmed that gender moderates the adoption of mHealth apps in Spain. The explanatory capacity (R2 for behavioral intention to use) of the proposed model was 76.4%. Likewise, the relationships of the external constructs of the extended TAM were found to be significant. Results: The results show the importance of healthy habits developed by using mHealth apps. In addition, communication campaigns for these apps should be aimed at transferring the usefulness of eHealth as an agent for transforming attitudes; additionally, as more health benefits are obtained, ease of use becomes greater. Perceived usefulness (PU; ?=.415, t0.001;4999=3.442, P=.001), attitude toward using (?=.301, t0.01;499=2.299, P=.02), and promotion of health (?=.210, t0.05;499=2.108, P=.03) were found to have a statistically significant impact on behavior intention to use eHealth apps (R2=76.4%). Perceived ease of use (PEOU; ?=.179, t0.01;499=2.623, P=.009) and PU (?=.755, t0.001;499=12.888, P<.001) were found to have a statistically significant impact on attitude toward using (R2>=78.2%). Furthermore, PEOU (?=.203, t0.01;499=2.810, P=.005), health benefits (?=.448, t0.001;499=4.010, P<.001), and promotion of health (?=.281, t0.01;499=2.393, P=.01) exerted a significant impact on PU (R2=72.7%). Finally, health benefits (?=.640, t0.001;499=14.948, P<.001) had a statistically significant impact on PEOU (R2=40.9%), while promotion of health (?=.865, t0.001;499=29.943, P<.001) significantly influenced health benefits (R2=74.7%). Conclusions: mHealth apps could be used to predict the behavior of patients in the face of recommendations to prevent pandemics, such as COVID-19 or SARS, and to track users'symptoms while they stay at home. Gender is a determining factor that influences the intention to use mHealth apps, so perhaps different interfaces and utilities could be designed according to gender. © 2021 JMIR Publications.

However, currently, very few countries have systems that can implement digital interventions at scale. This is partly because of the lack of interoperable electronic health records (EHRs). It is difficult to make decisions for an individual or population when the data on that person or population are dispersed over multiple incompatible systems. This viewpoint paper has highlighted some key obstacles of current EHRs and some promising successes, with the goal of promoting EHR evolution and advocating for frameworks that develop digital health systems that serve populations-a critical goal as we move further into this data-rich century with an ever-increasing number of patients who live longer and depend on health care services where resources may already be strained. This paper aimed to analyze the evolution, obstacles, and current landscape of EHRs and identify fundamental areas of hindrance for interoperability. It also aimed to highlight countries where advances have been made and extract best practices from these examples. The obstacles to EHR interoperability are not easily solved, but improving the current situation in countries where a national policy is not in place will require a focused inquiry into solutions from various sources in the public and private sector. Effort must be made on a national scale to seek solutions for optimally interoperable EHRs beyond status quo solutions. A list of considerations for best practices is suggested. © 2021 JMIR Cancer.

The odds ratio for risk of developing disease with a positive FHH is frequently greater than 2, and actions can be taken to mitigate risk by adhering to screening guidelines, genetic counselling, genetic risk testing, and other screening methods. Challenges to the routine acquisition of FHH include constraints on provider time to collect data and the difficulty in accessing risk calculators. Disease-specific and broader risk assessment software platforms have been developed, many with clinical decision support and informatics interoperability, but few access patient information directly. Software that allows integration of FHH with the electronic medical record and clinical decision support capabilities has provided solutions to many of these challenges. Patient facing, electronic medical record, and web-enabled FHH platforms have been developed, and can provide greater identification of risk compared with conventional FHH ascertainment in primary care.

At the same time, new technologies and the electronic health record (EHR) in particular have permeated the oncology clinic. Initially designed as billing and clinical documentation systems, EHR systems have not anticipated the complexity and variety of genomic information that needs to be reviewed, interpreted, and acted upon on a daily basis. Improved integration of cancer genomic data with EHR systems will help guide clinician decision making, support secondary uses, and ultimately improve patient care within oncology clinics. Some of the key factors relating to the challenge of integrating cancer genomic data into EHRs include: the bioinformatics pipelines that translate raw genomic data into meaningful, actionable results; the role of human curation in the interpretation of variant calls; and the need for consistent standards with regard to genomic and clinical data. Several emerging paradigms for integration are discussed in this review, including: non-standardized efforts between individual institutions and genomic testing laboratories; ""middleware"" products that portray genomic information, albeit outside of the clinical workflow; and application programming interfaces that have the potential to work within clinical workflow. The critical need for clinical-genomic knowledge bases, which can be independent or integrated into the aforementioned solutions, is also discussed. © 2016 The Author(s).",,"Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Electronic Health Records; Genomics; Health Information Systems; Humans; Medical Informatics; Medical Oncology; Medical Records Systems, Computerized; Neoplasms; Systems Integration; circulating cell free tumor DNA; DNA; gefitinib; imatinib; osimertinib; ponatinib; rociletinib; unclassified drug; vemurafenib; bioinformatics; cancer diagnosis; cancer immunotherapy; cancer prevention; cancer prognosis; chronic myeloid leukemia; DNA methylation; DNA sequence; electronic health record; flow cytometry; fluorescence in situ hybridization; gastrointestinal stromal tumor; gene expression; genomics; human; immunohistochemistry; information processing; knowledge base; lung adenocarcinoma; mass cytometry; melanoma; middleware; monitoring; next generation sequencing; non small cell lung cancer; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; Review; sequence analysis; standard; whole exome sequencing; whole genome sequencing; clinical decision support system; electronic health record; electronic medical record system; genetics; genomics; medical informatics; medical information system; Neoplasms; oncology; procedures; statistics and numerical data; system analysis",BioMed Central Ltd.,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,0,"no technological concepts, interoperability frameworks, or FHIR/SMART on FHIR standard",,,

The development and implementation trajectory of clinical AI models are complex and a structured overview is missing. We therefore propose a step-by-step overview to enhance clinicians' understanding and to promote quality of medical AI research. Methods We summarised key elements (such as current guidelines, challenges, regulatory documents and good practices) that are needed to develop and safely implement AI in medicine. Conclusion This overview complements other frameworks in a way that it is accessible to stakeholders without prior AI knowledge and as such provides a step-by-step approach incorporating all the key elements and current guidelines that are essential for implementation, and can thereby help to move AI from bytes to bedside.  © ",artificial intelligence; data science; machine learning,Artificial Intelligence; Biomedical Research; Humans; artificial intelligence; human; medical research; medicine; priority journal; privacy; reliability; Review; simulation; medical research,BMJ Publishing Group,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,0,"no technological concepts, interoperability frameworks, or FHIR/SMART on FHIR standard",,,

Dietary screening or counseling is not usually a component of routine medical visits. Moreover, numerous barriers exist to the implementation of screening and counseling, including lack of training and knowledge, lack of time, sense of futility, lack of reimbursement, competing demands during the visit, and absence of validated rapid diet screener tools with coupled clinical decision support to identify actionable modifications for improvement. With more widespread use of electronic health records, there is an enormous unmet opportunity to provide evidence-based clinician-delivered dietary guidance using rapid diet screener tools that must be addressed.

Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms that learn how to accurately predict outcome variables using large sets of predictor variables that are typically not hand selected and are minimally curated. Models are parameterized using a training data set and then applied to a test data set on which predictive performance is evaluated. The application of ML algorithms to the problem of AMR has garnered increasing interest in the past 5 years due to the exponential growth of experimental and clinical data, heavy investment in computational capacity, improvements in algorithm performance, and increasing urgency for innovative approaches to reducing the burden of disease. Here, we review the current state of research at the intersection of ML and AMR with an emphasis on three domains of work. The first is the prediction of AMR using genomic data. The second is the use of ML to gain insight into the cellular functions disrupted by antibiotics, which forms the basis for understanding mechanisms of action and developing novel anti-infectives. The third focuses on the application of ML for antimicrobial stewardship using data extracted from the electronic health record. Although the use of ML for understanding, diagnosing, treating, and preventing AMR is still in its infancy, the continued growth of data and interest ensures it will become an important tool for future translational research programs.  © 2021 American Society for Microbiology.",antibiotic resistance; antimicrobial stewardship; drug discovery; machine learning; mechanisms of action; whole-genome sequencing,"Anti-Bacterial Agents; Anti-Infective Agents; Artificial Intelligence; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Humans; Machine Learning; Translational Medical Research; antiinfective agent; antibiotic resistance; artificial intelligence; human; machine learning; translational research",American Society for Microbiology,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,0,"no technological concepts, interoperability frameworks, or FHIR/SMART on FHIR standard",,,

For proper and effective management of oral cancer, early diagnosis and accurate prediction of prognosis are important. To achieve this, artificial intelligence (AI) or its subfield, machine learning, has been touted for its potential to revolutionize cancer management through improved diagnostic precision and prediction of outcomes. Yet, to date, it has made only few contributions to actual medical practice or patient care. Objectives: This study provides a systematic review of diagnostic and prognostic application of machine learning in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and also highlights some of the limitations and concerns of clinicians towards the implementation of machine learning-based models for daily clinical practice. Data sources: We searched OvidMedline, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) databases from inception until February 2020 for articles that used machine learning for diagnostic or prognostic purposes of OSCC. Eligibility criteria: Only original studies that examined the application of machine learning models for prognostic and/or diagnostic purposes were considered. Data extraction: Independent extraction of articles was done by two researchers (A.R. & O.Y) using predefine study selection criteria. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) in the searching and screening processes. We also used Prediction model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) for assessing the risk of bias (ROB) and quality of included studies. Results: A total of 41 studies were published to have used machine learning to aid in the diagnosis/or prognosis of OSCC. The majority of these studies used the support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms as machine learning techniques. Their specificity ranged from 0.57 to 1.00, sensitivity from 0.70 to 1.00, and accuracy from 63.4 % to 100.0 % in these studies. The main limitations and concerns can be grouped as either the challenges inherent to the science of machine learning or relating to the clinical implementations. Conclusion: Machine learning models have been reported to show promising performances for diagnostic and prognostic analyses in studies of oral cancer. These models should be developed to further enhance explainability, interpretability, and externally validated for generalizability in order to be safely integrated into daily clinical practices. Also, regulatory frameworks for the adoption of these models in clinical practices are necessary. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Explainable AI; Machine learning; Oral squamous cell carcinoma; Systematic review,"Artificial Intelligence; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Machine Learning; Mouth Neoplasms; Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck; Diagnosis; Diseases; Extraction; Forecasting; Neural networks; Predictive analytics; Risk assessment; Search engines; Support vector machines; Effective management; Eligibility criterion; Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers; Machine learning models; Machine learning techniques; Oral squamous cell carcinomata; Prognostic analysis; Regulatory frameworks; accuracy; artificial neural network; autofluorescence; automation; Bayesian network; cancer diagnosis; cancer prognosis; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; clinical practice; confocal laser scanning microscopy; convolutional neural network; decision tree; deep neural network; disease specific survival; feature selection; fuzzy system; histopathology; human; immunohistochemistry; k nearest neighbor; lymph node metastasis; machine learning; mouth cancer; mouth squamous cell carcinoma; multilayer perceptron; overall survival; priority journal; random forest; relevance vector machine; Review; sensitivity and specificity; support vector machine; survival rate; systematic review; tongue carcinoma; artificial intelligence; head and neck tumor; machine learning; meta analysis; mouth tumor; squamous cell carcinoma; Learning systems",Elsevier B.V.,,,,Review,Final,,0,"no technological concepts, interoperability frameworks, or FHIR/SMART on FHIR standard",,,

Although successful in promoting EHR adoption and use, the program, and other contributing factors, also produced important unintended consequences (UCs) with far-reaching implications for the US health system. Based on our own experiences from large health information technology (HIT) adoption projects and a collection of key studies in HIT evaluation, we discuss the most prominent UCs of MU: failed expectations, EHR market saturation, innovation vacuum, physician burnout, and data obfuscation. We identify challenges resulting from these UCs and provide recommendations for future research to empower the broader medical and informatics communities to realize the full potential of a now digitized health system. We believe that fixing these unanticipated effects will demand efforts from diverse players such as health care providers, administrators, HIT vendors, policy makers, informatics researchers, funding agencies, and outside developers; promotion of new business models; collaboration between academic medical centers and informatics research departments; and improved methods for evaluations of HIT. ©Tiago K Colicchio, James J Cimino, Guilherme Del Fiol.",Adoption; Meaningful use; Medical informatics applications,Electronic Health Records; Humans; Meaningful Use; Medical Informatics; United States; administrative personnel; adoption; burnout; funding; health care personnel; human; meaningful use criteria; medical informatics; review; scientist; university hospital; electronic health record; meaningful use criteria; medical informatics; procedures; United States,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,0/1,"no reference implementation, infrastructure, but something about SMART",,,

However, there remain challenges and issues to resolve in this domain owing to the lack of proper standards, the growth of new technologies (mobile devices, tablets, ubiquitous computing), and health care providers who are reluctant to share patient information. Therefore, a solid systematic literature review was performed to understand the use of this new technology in the health care sector. To the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of comprehensive systematic literature reviews that focus on Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR)-based electronic health records (EHRs). In addition, FHIR is the latest standard, which is in an infancy stage of development. Therefore, this is a hot research topic with great potential for further research in this domain. Objective: The main aim of this study was to explore and perform a systematic review of the literature related to FHIR, including the challenges, implementation, opportunities, and future FHIR applications. Methods: In January 2020, we searched articles published from January 2012 to December 2019 via all major digital databases in the field of computer science and health care, including ACM, IEEE Explorer, Springer, Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect. We identified 8181 scientific articles published in this field, 80 of which met our inclusion criteria for further consideration. Results: The selected 80 scientific articles were reviewed systematically, and we identified open questions, challenges, implementation models, used resources, beneficiary applications, data migration approaches, and goals of FHIR. Conclusions: The literature analysis performed in this systematic review highlights the important role of FHIR in the health care domain in the near future.  © Muhammad Ayaz, Muhammad F Pasha, Mohammed Y Alzahrani, Rahmat Budiarto, Deris Stiawan.",CDA Substitutable Medical Applications Reusable Technologies; Clinical document architecture; EHR; Electronic health record; Fast Health Interoperability Resources; FHIR; Health standard; HL7; SMART; Systematic literature review,,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,1,,,,

However, there has been a recent push towards patient-driven interoperability, in which health data exchange is patient-mediated and patient-driven. Patient-centered interoperability, however, brings with it new challenges and requirements around security and privacy, technology, incentives, and governance that must be addressed for this type of data sharing to succeed at scale. In this paper, we look at how blockchain technology might facilitate this transition through five mechanisms: (1) digital access rules, (2) data aggregation, (3) data liquidity, (4) patient identity, and (5) data immutability. We then look at barriers to blockchain-enabled patient-driven interoperability, specifically clinical data transaction volume, privacy and security, patient engagement, and incentives. We conclude by noting that while patient-driving interoperability is an exciting trend in healthcare, given these challenges, it remains to be seen whether blockchain can facilitate the transition from institution-centric to patient-centric data sharing. © 2018 The Authors",Application programming interface; Blockchain; Clinical data; Data exchange; Interoperability,Application programming interfaces (API); Blockchain; Data privacy; Health care; Interoperability; Applications programming interfaces; Block-chain; Business entities; Clinical data; Data Sharing; Digital access; Health data; Privacy technologies; Security and privacy; Security technology; blockchain technology; clinical study; data analysis; data interoperability; health care; health care access; health care cost; health care policy; human; medical informatics; medical information; medical information system; medical technology; patient care; patient identification; patient participation; priority journal; privacy; Review; transitional care; trend study; Electronic data interchange,Elsevier B.V.,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,0,"no SMART on FHIR, Focus on blockchain",,,

However, there are currently limited examples of such techniques being successfully deployed into clinical practice. This article explores the main challenges and limitations of AI in healthcare, and considers the steps required to translate these potentially transformative technologies from research to clinical practice. Main body: Key challenges for the translation of AI systems in healthcare include those intrinsic to the science of machine learning, logistical difficulties in implementation, and consideration of the barriers to adoption as well as of the necessary sociocultural or pathway changes. Robust peer-reviewed clinical evaluation as part of randomised controlled trials should be viewed as the gold standard for evidence generation, but conducting these in practice may not always be appropriate or feasible. Performance metrics should aim to capture real clinical applicability and be understandable to intended users. Regulation that balances the pace of innovation with the potential for harm, alongside thoughtful post-market surveillance, is required to ensure that patients are not exposed to dangerous interventions nor deprived of access to beneficial innovations. Mechanisms to enable direct comparisons of AI systems must be developed, including the use of independent, local and representative test sets. Developers of AI algorithms must be vigilant to potential dangers, including dataset shift, accidental fitting of confounders, unintended discriminatory bias, the challenges of generalisation to new populations, and the unintended negative consequences of new algorithms on health outcomes. Conclusion: The safe and timely translation of AI research into clinically validated and appropriately regulated systems that can benefit everyone is challenging. Robust clinical evaluation, using metrics that are intuitive to clinicians and ideally go beyond measures of technical accuracy to include quality of care and patient outcomes, is essential. Further work is required (1) to identify themes of algorithmic bias and unfairness while developing mitigations to address these, (2) to reduce brittleness and improve generalisability, and (3) to develop methods for improved interpretability of machine learning predictions. If these goals can be achieved, the benefits for patients are likely to be transformational. © 2019 The Author(s).",Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Evaluation; Machine learning; Regulation; Translation,Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Peer Review; adoption; adult; algorithm; artificial intelligence; clinical evaluation; clinical practice; controlled study; gold standard; human; machine learning; postmarketing surveillance; prediction; randomized controlled trial (topic); review; health care delivery; peer review,BioMed Central Ltd.,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,0,"no technological concepts, interoperability frameworks, or FHIR/SMART on FHIR standard",,,

Months later, his wife asks him to see a doctor, who diagnoses a seborrheic keratosis. Later, when the patient undergoes a screening colonoscopy, a nurse notices a dark macule on his shoulder and advises him to have it evaluated. One month later, the patient sees a dermatologist, who obtains a biopsy specimen of the lesion. The findings reveal a noncancerous pigmented lesion. Still concerned, the dermatologist requests a second reading of the biopsy specimen, and invasive melanoma is diagnosed. An oncologist initiates treatment with systemic chemotherapy. A physician friend asks the patient why he is not receiving immunotherapy.
