3,3,Braunstein M.L.,Health Informatics on FHIR: How HL7’s New API is Transforming Healthcare,2018,Health Informatics on FHIR: How HL7’s New API is Transforming Healthcare,43,10.1007/978-3-319-93414-3,"This textbook begins with an introduction to the US healthcare delivery system, its many systemic challenges and the prior efforts to develop and deploy informatics tools to help overcome those problems. It goes on to discuss health informatics from an historical perspective, its current state and its likely future state now that electronic health record systems are widely deployed, the HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability standard is being rapidly accepted as the means to access the data stored in those systems and analytics is increasing being used to gain new knowledge from that aggregated clinical data. It then turns to some of the important and evolving areas of informatics including population and public health, mHealth and big data and analytics. Use cases and case studies are used in all of these discussions to help readers connect the technologies to real world challenges.Effective use of informatics systems and tools by providers and their patients is key to improving the quality, safety and cost of healthcare. With health records now digital, no effective means has existed for sharing them with patients, among the multiple providers who may care for them and for important secondary uses such as public/population health and research. This problem is a topic of congressional discussion and is addressed by the 21st Century Cures Act of 2016 that mandates that electronic health record (EHR) systems offer a patient-facing API.HL7’s Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is that API and this is the first comprehensive treatment of the technology and the many ways it is already being used. FHIR is based on web technologies and is thus a far more facile, easy to implement approach that is rapidly gaining acceptance. It is also the basis for a ‘universal health app platform’ that literally has the potential to foster innovation around the data in patient records similar to the app ecosystems smartphones created around the data they store. FHIR app stores have already been opened by Epic and Cerner, the two largest enterprise EHR vendors.Provider facing apps are already being explored to improve EHR usability and support personalized medicine. Medicare and the Veteran’s Administration have announced FHIR app platforms for their patients. Apple’s new IOS 11.3 features the ability for consumers to aggregate their health records on their iPhone using FHIR. Health insurance companies are exploring applications of FHIR to improve service and communication with their providers and patients. SureScripts, the national e-Prescribing network, is using FHIR to help doctors know if their patients are complying with prescriptions.This textbook is for introductory health informatics courses for computer science and health sciences students (e.g. doctors, nurses, PhDs), the current health informatics community, IT professionals interested in learning about the field and practicing healthcare providers. Though this textbook covers an important new technology, it is accessible to non-technical readers including healthcare providers, their patients or anyone interested in the use of healthcare data for improved care, public/population health or research. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

IT is how the innovative design behind clinical informatics concepts ultimately are presented externally in the real world. For that reason, one must become intimately familiar with what is possible using IT while navigating its boundaries. This chapter will take the reader through ways to represent data, write programs, and conceptualize networks. With some practice, clinical informaticists will understand the trade-offs in various approaches and make the decisions that will produce a reliable IT system for their organization. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.",Agile method; Application programming interface; Data interoperability; Data warehouses; Database schema; Entity-relationship diagram; ETL; Health information exchange; HIPAA; Network topology; Programming languages; Relational database; Structured query language; Structured/Unstructured data; Waterfall method,,Springer International Publishing,,,,Book chapter,Final,,1,,is equal to 19,,
19,19,Hersh W.,Healthcare Data and Exchange Standards,2022,Clinical Informatics Study Guide,0,10.1007/978-3-030-93765-2_13,"Data standards are critical for the interoperability of data across electronic health records (EHRs) and other clinical information systems. This chapter describes how standards are developed and by whom. It begins with the rationale for standards and their importance in the interoperability of data. It then covers the four major types of standards. The first of these is identifier standards, which represent people and organizations in the healthcare system, and, most importantly patients. Next are transaction standards that regularize business interactions among healthcare providers, organizations, governments, and others. This is followed by messaging standards, which move different types of data between information systems. Finally, are terminology standards that normalize terms and concepts used for diagnoses, treatments, and other aspects of care. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the emerging SMART on FHIR standard and its critical role in achieving interoperability going forward. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.",Data standards; Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR); HL7; Identifier standards; Interoperability; Messaging standards; Reusable technologies (SMART); Substitutable Medical Apps; Terminology standards; Transaction standards,,Springer International Publishing,,,,Book chapter,Final,,1,,is equal to 14,,

This requiresmobile and desktop applications for patients and medical providers to obtain healthcare data from multiple HITs, which may be operating with different paradigms (e.g., cloud services, programming services, web services), use different cloud service providers, and employ different security/access control techniques. To address these issues, this chapter introduces and discusses an Access Control Framework for Secure and Interoperable Cloud Computing (FSICC) that provides a mechanism for multiple HITs to register cloud, programming, and web services and security requirements for use by applications. FSICC supports a global security policy and enforcement mechanism for cloud services with role-based (RBAC), discretionary (DAC), and mandatory (MAC) access controls. The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard models healthcare data using a set of 93 resources to track a patient's clinical findings, problems, etc. For each resource, an FHIR Application Program Interface (API) is defined to share data in a common format for each HIT that can be accessed by mobile applications. Thus, there is a need to support with a heterogeneous set of information sources and differing security protocols (i.e., RBAC, DAC, and MAC). To demonstrate the realization of FSICC, we apply the framework to the integration of the Connecticut Concussion Tracker (CT2) mHealth application with the OpenEMR electronic medical record utilizing FHIR. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",,,Springer Singapore,,,,Book chapter,Final,,1,,,,
65,65,Tabari P.; Costagliola G.; De Rosa M.; Boeker M.,State-of-the-Art Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)–Based Data Model and Structure Implementations: Systematic Scoping Review,2024,JMIR Medical Informatics,0,10.2196/58445,"Background: Data models are crucial for clinical research as they enable researchers to fully use the vast amount of clinical data stored in medical systems. Standardized data and well-defined relationships between data points are necessary to guarantee semantic interoperability. Using the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard for clinical data representation would be a practical methodology to enhance and accelerate interoperability and data availability for research. Objective: This research aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art and current landscape in FHIR-based data models and structures. In addition, we intend to identify and discuss the tools, resources, limitations, and other critical aspects mentioned in the selected research papers. Methods: To ensure the extraction of reliable results, we followed the instructions of the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist. We analyzed the indexed articles in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, the ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar. After identifying, extracting, and assessing the quality and relevance of the articles, we synthesized the extracted data to identify common patterns, themes, and variations in the use of FHIR-based data models and structures across different studies. Results: On the basis of the reviewed articles, we could identify 2 main themes: dynamic (pipeline-based) and static data models. The articles were also categorized into health care use cases, including chronic diseases, COVID-19 and infectious diseases, cancer research, acute or intensive care, random and general medical notes, and other conditions. Furthermore, we summarized the important or common tools and approaches of the selected papers. These items included FHIR-based tools and frameworks, machine learning approaches, and data storage and security. The most common resource was “Observation” followed by “Condition” and “Patient.” The limitations and challenges of developing data models were categorized based on the issues of data integration, interoperability, standardization, performance, and scalability or generalizability. Conclusions: FHIR serves as a highly promising interoperability standard for developing real-world health care apps. The implementation of FHIR modeling for electronic health record data facilitates the integration, transmission, and analysis of data while also advancing translational research and phenotyping. Generally, FHIR-based exports of local data repositories improve data interoperability for systems and data warehouses across different settings. However, ongoing efforts to address existing limitations and challenges are essential for the successful implementation and integration of FHIR data models. ©Parinaz Tabari, Gennaro Costagliola, Mattia De Rosa, Martin Boeker.",data model; Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources; FHIR; interoperability; modeling; PRISMA,,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,1,,,,
161,161,Ayaz M.; Pasha M.F.; Alzahrani M.Y.; Budiarto R.; Stiawan D.,"The Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FIHR) Standard: Systematic literature review of implementations, pplications, challenges and opportunities",2021,JMIR Medical Informatics,109,10.2196/21929,"Background: Information technology has shifted paper-based documentation in the health care sector into a digital form, in which patient information is transferred electronically from one place to another. However, there remain challenges and issues to resolve in this domain owing to the lack of proper standards, the growth of new technologies (mobile devices, tablets, ubiquitous computing), and health care providers who are reluctant to share patient information. Therefore, a solid systematic literature review was performed to understand the use of this new technology in the health care sector. To the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of comprehensive systematic literature reviews that focus on Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR)-based electronic health records (EHRs). In addition, FHIR is the latest standard, which is in an infancy stage of development. Therefore, this is a hot research topic with great potential for further research in this domain. Objective: The main aim of this study was to explore and perform a systematic review of the literature related to FHIR, including the challenges, implementation, opportunities, and future FHIR applications. Methods: In January 2020, we searched articles published from January 2012 to December 2019 via all major digital databases in the field of computer science and health care, including ACM, IEEE Explorer, Springer, Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect. We identified 8181 scientific articles published in this field, 80 of which met our inclusion criteria for further consideration. Results: The selected 80 scientific articles were reviewed systematically, and we identified open questions, challenges, implementation models, used resources, beneficiary applications, data migration approaches, and goals of FHIR. Conclusions: The literature analysis performed in this systematic review highlights the important role of FHIR in the health care domain in the near future.  © Muhammad Ayaz, Muhammad F Pasha, Mohammed Y Alzahrani, Rahmat Budiarto, Deris Stiawan.",CDA Substitutable Medical Applications Reusable Technologies; Clinical document architecture; EHR; Electronic health record; Fast Health Interoperability Resources; FHIR; Health standard; HL7; SMART; Systematic literature review,,JMIR Publications Inc.,,,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,1,,,,
